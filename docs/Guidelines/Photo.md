## **NYU Langone Health – Headshot Photo Guidelines** 

The Creative Services Department recommends using your NYU bio page portrait. 

For those who don’t have a professional portrait, you may submit an image with the following guidelines;

- Subject facing forward, eye contact, taken from the waist up with room above head 

- Background should be clean and uncluttered, a colored/textured background works well (NO white backgrounds)

- Photo should be submitted in the original format (jpg, jpeg, or tiff), as a high-resolution, digital color image (ideally 2mb / 300 dpi)

 Images that reflect your social life and/or selfies will not be accepted.

Your headshot should reflect your role at this institution as a professional.
