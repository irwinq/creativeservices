# Final Refection

We are very proud of the final project as a real, playable game. But it's time to go back and see which part we did wrong and how we could improve the future. 

This article might be packed a lot of stuff together,  so I am going to break it down into little small topics so it's easier to read. 

Also, I would love to document the hardship and the choice we made together throughout the journey. In the last part of this reflection, I could talk about what I learned from team collaboration.

## Background

Virtual Reality is not a stranger to me, and I had some experience using VRTK. I used VRTK for my undergraduate honor thesis; I mentioned it on my first assignment, introducing the Lincoln Centennial Mall.

Since I am familiar with VRTK, my original plan is to use VRTK to build the macro project. I switched to XR Interaction Toolkit for a couple of reasons. 

- VRTK has very few updates, and it feels like the creator shifted in another direction. 
- We use XR Interaction Toolkit in the class, and I really hope I could keep the same pace with everyone else in the class 
- XR Interaction Toolkit is created by Unity itself. It will have better adaptability with Unity, and it might have more features in the future. 

## My Role

This probably will be the hardest part to talk about. Our work is so intertwined together, so it's hard to distinguish who did what part. 

During the first couple of discussions, they all talked about how this game could be and how the gameplay is. I didn't speak that much and remain pretty calm. I said something like: 

"Yea, that's a great idea, but how do we actually make it work in Unity?"

I guess I have an official name as buzz killer in the group. I didn't mean to take down their brilliant idea. But I understand back my undergraduate thesis, and I had a lot of great ideas, but I don't know how to implanted them using VRTK. I am trying really hard to set a lower standard so our programming techniques could match the idea we made. 

After several testing, we noticed the scene is too big to build, and it is needless huge. So I decided to redo a new scene completely and separated indoor and outdoor. 



## Gameplay

Our game mechanics works are actually discovered by one accident. Or one idea just pops up in our mind. We created this script; when the player collides with the game object, the game object's X, Y, and Z will change to another place. You can call this object has been teleported to another place. Our original intention is to create a script so then the player finds a kibble and teleport to a certain location. 

We shifted game mechanics from the old collective and move to a new place in a different direction. There will be a silhouette so the player could know what kind of object they need to find.  



## Feedback We Got

Along the way, we got several feedbacks from our TA Lynn and Zander. 

Lynn gives us extremely great feedback: How do players know that the player is a cat? 

After the feedback we got from Lynn, Jenny creates a cat paw asset we used in the game. It adds another level of cute and joy into the game. 

Zander joined the conversation and really pushed our game to the next level. He mentioned our look and visual language does not really match, with something really low poly, and something is not. And the color theme is not a match. He also mentioned creating a cat bag and changed the view as inside the cat. 

I mentioned it might too hard to do. He used one of his insights from his presentation. 

"This is incredibly hard." 

I hope I could continue to learn, especially the programming part. In one guest lecture from Leah, she mentioned several potential obstacles in VR developments. Back in the time, I didn't fully understand the obstacle we were facing; now, I understand if we want to make this game better, we might have to look for more resources and potential funding options. 



## Team appreciation and Future 

I can't ask for a better team. We all work really hard and contribute to every aspect of our strength to make this game better. We learned from each other I learned a lot from my team members, especially the aspect that I am not really familiar with, like Sound design and programming script. 

Although the journey of this game might end here, our journey about developing virtual Reality has just started here. We will continue to work in this field and keep research on improving accessibility in VR.

Thank you for everything!
