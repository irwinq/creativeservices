# Week 9 Accessibility and Affordance in VR

The last lecture was one of my favorite classes because the new blood joined our class. I was very excited that Regine joined our class, and we discussed so many things in VR about accessibility. 

I learned a lot during her class about UX design. It is very important that the educators pass down those mindsets that care about accessibility from day one. When the time we are ready and become UX design on the job market, we could utilize what we learned and implementing to our daily work assignment. 

I enjoyed the part Lynn shared her work. Her implementation of the design into her Harry Poter theme game merged really well. I haven't talked with her yet, but I am planning to schedule some office hours with her about learning from her past experience. 

In my undergraduate thesis, I studied and talked about the affordability in VR. 

Affordability and accessibility like two apples from the same apple tree; it has connected roots. Affordability expanded further to the normal user compared to accessibility might more targeting users with disabilities. 

Affordability in VR is a huge topic and could expand further, but I am trying to limit it as the study of developers is trying to mimic the real-life physicals and interaction in the VR environment. Affordability is rooted as the attribute into the character of the game. For example, a good gun game will have a proper trigger value to trigger the trigger (wow, what a tongue-twisting sentence) from 0.3 to 0.9. And leave the 1.0 for auto fire. That mimics how hard we press in real armors. 

Affordability in VR should also expand to using the familiar way to interact with the game. The game should have some way to interact with the traditional keyboard and give the user the option to switch. That brings to the issue of accessibility. If someone only has one hand, the support of a traditional keyboard could allow users to continue to play the game. The support of the Xbox Adaptive Controller will allow more gamers to join the game. 

I hope we have more time to talk about accessibility in class. Although in our game, we don't have the power, time, resources, or technical knowledge to do the accessibility debugging. But I hope during the final presentation, I could talk about our goal and our plan about the accessibility in the future.
