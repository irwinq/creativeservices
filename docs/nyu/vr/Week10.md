# Week 10 Notes from Guest Speaker

I really enjoyed the lecture from a guest speaker. They brought so many things - no matter advice or past experience, or the example they love from other artists - to the table. 

I mentioned in the group chat that I have rewatched the recording for this presentation. Leah didn't go too fast. Her speed is great, but because of so many things she mentioned is something we could take notes. 

I am going to use this week's responses as a canvas to document some notes I took during her presentation and also added some responses. It could be a note for myself for future reference. 
The bold part is the note I took during the class, and the others are my response. 

**Potential Obstacles:** 

**Finances (VR Development is expensive)**

**Looking for Funding Options like Grants,  crowdsourcing, partnerships, and sponsorships**

While there are so many tools available on the market to help the developers reduce the time and make their work easier. The VR development is still so intense. 

My personal experience is that it impossible for one person to be good at everything. Some people might be good at 3D modeling, and writing and programming script will be an issue. Hiring outside resources will be both times consuming also be a financial burden. 

**Keep narrative short and take the user on the journey** 

- **story process**
- **call to action**
- **audience takeaway** 

**Do not perpetuate stereotypes, biases**

**Why does the story need to be in VR?**

The question of "why does the story need to be in VRï¼Ÿ" is a power question. I noticed so many times people went for the route of VR just because it sounds fancy, and it turns out the experience is bad. The barrier of the headset, motion sickness, etc., damaged the process of the story process. I think she brought this question to the table and asked this question before the development. 

She also mentioned accessibility, and I talked about several things I learned from Regine in the last micro assignment. While right now, is the developers are pushing accessibility, where the area should push by the big company like Epic Games, Unity, Adobe, where they have more resources to provide API or SDK for the developers. 

It reminds me of one year of Apple's WWDC; they released this video.

I am looking forward that XR Toolkit could have an accessibility plugin, or all other development tools could embrace the current W3C accessibility standard. So people with disabilities could make the game as we are. 

Also, thank you for bringing our wonderful guest speaker, and I learned a lot from them.
