# Week 3

## Discussion Post

I still haven't received my Oculus Headset, but I do have access to PS4 VR, and I had Oculus Headset experience. 

I have the motion sickness issue. During the development, one of the things that could freak me out is the model is wrong. It's "stranger things" in real if I poke my head of the model and see the other side of the model texture. There is one incident, the settings of FOV is wrong, or some weird bug happened; I was being teleported to somewhere nowhere in very high up. I can see the void, and the land I created is so small. 

Another issue that could trigger my motion sickness (probably the main reason) is the low refresh rate. Most headset now has a 90Hz refresh rate. When I first import my experience project, which optimized for Oculus Rift but not Quest. The computing power of Quest is not enough to handle the polygon computer that can handle it. The refresh rate has dropped to 20Hz and even lower. It made me very sick. 
Oculus has that guide boundary system whenever you are too close to the boundary system, it will warn you. Maybe because VR is not new for me, I barely feel that I forgot about the physical. Maybe because I keep telling myself that I am in a virtual space, everything is not really moving to handle motion sickness better. 

On the other hand, VR does let me forgot about physical reality.


I can't play horror games in VR; I tried a little bit, then I have to give up because it's too intense. In the PC and console games, there is a boundary between me and the screen. I know whatever showing on the screen is not true, while the VR breaks this kind of balance. I was playing Farpoint, an FPS game. When an alien bug jumped on my face, I have to take a break and take off the VR headset for a while. 

In the other class, we have read an article about hand gestures and feedback. The author wrote the article in 2011, the year before VR starts to bloom. He said: 

> Directly manipulating a virtual 3D representation (Iron Man, if I remember right?) would have the problem of not being able to feel what you're manipulating, which I suspect would really throw off your proprioceptive senses. My (brief) experiences trying to manipulate objects by Waving My Hands In The Air have not been positive, because my hands were rarely where I thought they were.

The biggest limitation of the VR experience is the lack of feedback. Currently, everything is haptic feedback. It's limited, over-simplified, limited because of current technology. Ready Player One and so many other Sci-fi movies have shown us the possibility in the future. Maybe it will be ready in the next corner.

Always appreciate you read my rambling stuff here.
