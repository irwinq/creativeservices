# Week 13 Zander's Visit 

Zander's feedbacks are super valuable to our group. After we get his feedback, we adjusted several gameplay elements based on his feedback. 

Before talking about the one on one with our group, I would love to talk about his presentation first. His presentation shared a lot of brilliant insight from him. 

> "This is incredibly hard" 

One of his quotes from the presentation, and he used it again during our group meetings. I really like his infographic about all the curves he showed us. Although it is a little bit hard to read during the environment of Mozilla Hub, I downloaded his presentation document and took notes about that infographic. 

Coming from an advertising background, I really appreciate someone who worked in this field and shared his perspective and "behind the work" with me. He mentioned his path as Creative Director and the meaning behind this job title. He said being a creative director is like a cross between the intern, artist, and executive producerâ€”this sentence highly summarized as a creative director, you have to understand every step of the way. 

Sometimes you have to work on the project by yourself as an artist. Sometimes you have learned something from the beginning, completely new, feel like an intern. 

Close to the end of the session, he mentioned the lesson he learned throughout the way. 

He said

> "Accept Failure as the default state."

 I guess that's the commons for advertising people. I once talk with my friend about the difference between science and arts as subjects. Science has less of a grey area, which means the right is right, and the wrong is wrong. You have an answer based on the calculation and formula.

But the arts, or all creative aspect, there never is an answer you can call it right. Everything you did is wrong until you succeed; before that, no one knows what success looks like or the right answer. He encouraged us to continue the good work while accepting failure as part of the journey. 

The feedback he gave us is about the team share, collaboration, color theme, and "how to being as a cat" We implemented a lot of his feedback to our game. He also mentioned the issue regarding motion sickness, so we added the onboarding process so the player could adapt it better.
