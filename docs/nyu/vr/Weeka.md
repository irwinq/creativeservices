# Week 11 Notes from Guest Speaker

It is really nice to know somewhere in the advertising worldâ€”the topic related to retail inevitably related to advertising and commercial campaigns. The advertising campaign usually has one goal is to promote more sales. It matches the goal with the retailers. His presentation is interesting and showed us a different perspective on how the brand campaign uses emerging technologies and how they are adapting new methods in such changing times. 

I noticed sometimes there is a gap between arts and ads. While ads need to be easy-to-understand for its most target audience, arts could be obscure and only focus on a certain group of people. His perspective of the future of retail sits closer to what I learned during my undergraduate as an advertising student. 
During the whole presentation, the main topic covered at the end of distance using emerging technologies. I understood the retail system as a point to point system. The first side of the point is the factors or sellers who made the product, and then the other side is the clients. 

One example he showed in the presentation could most represent how emerging interactive technology could benefit the retail business -- AR technology. I couldn't find who started with the AR product presentation at the beginning, but Apple released the ARKit, and the USDZ file format allows users to view the 3D rendering on their phone. 

Back in the old-time (not that old, but two years ago, things changed so rapidly recently), the most significant issue limiting the realness and reality is technology. The price either was too high, as the first generation of Hololens, no household could afford that. Everything changes when devices like Oculus could be accessed more easily. 

He showed several examples like Walby Parkers, Snapchat Filters, Ikea 3D indoor renderings as evidence that how technology helps developers achieve more.
