# Week 12 Reading Response 

Well, here's the final chapter of this book. I have to admit that I haven't read this far yet, but this chapter is fulfilled with the author's dream about the future. 

Gladly, he imagined a beautiful world that technology lives for us, and I saw a lot of technology he described in the story already came out. 

For example, when out of cinnamon, the story said he used Lenz-scan the bar code, and it added to the cart instantly. 

Amazon released a similar product a while ago and decided to discontinue it. It's part of the Alexa system, Amazon Dash Wand. Although Amazon never gives us a reason to discontinue this product, the feature is pretty redundant with other amazon products. 

The world he described similar to the movies he mentioned in the first couple of paragraphs. The Minority Report is one of my favorite sci-fi movies. The scene he described also has been imagined in the world of the last sci-fi TV show called upload. This show imagined that after we passed away, our minds could be upload to a centralized server and running as code. People could be anyone they want to be in this virtual reality world. 

Although I really wish that someday everything he stated in this short story could come true, he is too optimistic about the situation that might happen in the future. Oculus, owned by Facebook, has long-standing, trusting issues and privacy concerns from users. 

In the Netflix documentary movie, social Dilemma, one statement said: 

> "If you're not playing for the product, then you are the product." 

Justin Rosenstein, former Facebook and Google Engineer, said, 

> "When you think about how some of these companies work, it starts to make sense. There are all these services on the Internet that we think of as free,  but they're not free. They're paid by advertisers." 
>
> "Why do advertisers pay those companies? They pay in exchange for showing their ads to us. We're the product. Our attention is the product being sold to advertisers."  

The rise of technology will leave us less and less space to breathe the pure "non-digitized" air. 
We already wake up go directly to a screen; at least that's what I do, check for my email. Then I fall asleep with the screen, maybe check for TikTok before going to bed. I guess right now when already have enough screen. The story he describes in the story seems to add up more screen, more technology around the house, more smart home, more company could access our personal data, and less freedom. 

Should we always keep optimistic about the technology or take a pause and see how many wrong things we did in this process?
