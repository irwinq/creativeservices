# Week 7

Although this semester is remote for me, I can't meet my classmate in person and have very limited contact with human beings; I am still very glad that I could get to know their project and a little bit of personality.  

I really wish to move to Brooklyn as soon as possible, but I have to have knee surgery at the beginning of this semester. Taking classes remotely will be a smart decision. 

During the past several weeks, I often talk with my parents and talk about peer pressure at NYU. UNL is a great university, and I have it. But since it is a public university, it will not be too competitive. I took several cross-list classes which undergraduate and graduate student take all together, and I still don't feel too stressful. I could get an A if I tried hard. 
Here at NYU, I see my peers project, and they are super amazing. Sometimes I feel, "How could I be good as them?" 

Often I joked with my friend said: "I am so stressed out, they are smart than me, they have a better score, they work hard as well, the most important, they look 3X handsome than you are!" My friends agreed with me and responded with "Adulthood s***." 

This is a good kind of pressure tough. I am now super excited about the new assignment every week because I could always create (yea, being push to) great work. During my undergraduate, I usually create something portfolio worth thing only maybe once per semester. Now in order to match the extraordinary of my classmates, I have to put 500% effort. 

Those might not be related to the VR course. I am very excited about the final presentation of our group project. We are a group with so many different skills, especially Ben and Lily, could create dope music. Also, Ben handled a lot of scripts. We need to work fast!
