Down below is the part I wrote about this project.

## Whiskers in the Dark

::: tip Wrote before presentation

The following content was wrote before the presentation, please check next section for the refection wrote after the presentation.

For our group project: Whiskers in the dark, I served the roles and Producer, Creative Director. 

I worked for an advertising agency as a designer. Here, when I was communicating with my account manager, I can sense the pressure they were every project from both sides: clients and us. Clients usually have a very harsh deadline, and then the account manager communicates with us to make sure we can get everything done in time. This position requires strong interpersonal communications and manage stuff in detail. 

In this project as a role as Producer, I feel it is about the same. Although we don't have a client, the pressure is from my peers. The task is to create a tangible, manageable time plan. Although we don't have to actually make things real, it does seem very channeling. 

Outside as Producer, I took some jobs as a designer. I don't want to sound cocky, but I am confident that I could make slides looks nice. So when all of my group members just lay the content flat as text, I went back and picked up everything to make sure it has unique and uniform visual settings. 

I also draw the illustration of the black cat on my iPad with Procreate. I enjoyed doing this digital art for my group, also as a general design practice.

Finally, back to the main topic. Our timeline has been separated as for different phases: 

- Brainstorming, Narrative, Foundation 
- Gathering Art Assets and setting the game logics
- Production and Development 
- Game Release and Marketing

Each phase and individual weekly timeline:

In the end, I also added the platform we will be releasing our product toâ€”exmaple like Oculus Store and PSVR Store.

Chester joined our group meeting; it's very early in the morning in China. I very much appreciate his efforts. (I definitely can't get up that early) I recorded the Zoom meeting and cropped the video about him explaining the idea as a programmer. This video will be played during our presentations. 

Our group did an amazing job and came up with an amazing idea. I am very excited about the presentation tomorrow~



## Post Presentation Refection

### FOV Modification

Before the presentation, we noticed our group missed the accessibility champion. It means our content lacks the accessibility content. Me as the producer, I talked with my group members immediately. We started brainstorming about a few ways to make the game more accessible. 

After the presentation, we received feedback from the classmate. They mentioned we did a very thorough research about the accessibility. Honestly, that part was last-minute work, but those came from my undergraduate thesis and research about the FOV and how to reduce motion sickness. 

I personally being impact by motion sickness a lot. The only game I am not that sick is Beat Saber. There is no direct movement. That makes the game friendly for most first-time VR users. I read one paper wrote by Ajoy S Fernandes and Steven K Feiner about using FOV to reduce motion sickness. They both are professors at Columbia Engineering.

They utilized soft-edge cut-out, with 30 participles and separated them into the A/B group, proved that it could reduce motion sickness. The participles reported willingly to enable the soft-edge cut out in that research.

### More ways to Interact

The most unwanted thing to do in virtual reality is to type your password. Some users might have an easy password, but I have a password generated by the password manager. It usually contains 16 digitals with both upper and lower case special characters. It feels as hard as using a ROKU remote to input your password. 
Our team wishes to explore more ways to interact with game objects in virtual reality settings by adding back the traditional controller inclusively. 
Xbox Adaptive Controller is the first major gaming system designed for people with disabilities. Our approach to adaptive all different controllers on the market allows users to interact with the game in the ways they are familiar with. 
The game programming design will allow users to remap different controls to utilize different key maps. They can control the black cat using a keyboard as well as Xbox Adaptive Controller.
