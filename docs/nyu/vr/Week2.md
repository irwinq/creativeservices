## Daydream Study

::: tip Dream?!

Unfortunately, I barely dream, or I never remember my dream. Usually, when I am sick, I will get a weird dream, and most of the time is a nightmare. So it's kind of sad. I am a bit stressed out for this assignment because I am so realistic most of the time and barely daydream. So I am going to write a strange story. 

:::

Owen has a grey cat that seems abnormal today. His cat didn't eat or drink, only meowing all the time. Today is their first day moved into this new apartment. He assumes he is meowing because it's a new environment for him. His cat jumped up on a box, pushing both his both rear paws against it. Suddenly he jumped and pressed the doorknob; before I even noticed, he went out of the door. I chased him out, and he directly ran into the elevator. 

"Sorry Kiddo, I forgot my communication devices." The grey cat said. 

"I have to communicate with my plant." Owen dropped both his jaw and phone. He looked around the elevator; he is alone with his cat. 

"We are not dogs; we don't remember the old home. Drive me back, you stupid human." His cat was rolling the eyeballs and released his claw. "Take me back now." 

Owen picked the cat up, "I might need to see a psychiatrist." He turned on the engine and drive to the old apartment. He opened the door and allowed his cat to get in. 
"What are you looking? What communication devices?" The old apartment smells like bleach. Owen cleaned very thoroughly. "Where is my litter box?" 

"I threw it away; it's old." 

"But I like the old one, where is it?" "It might be still in the dumpster." 

"Grab it back now" "Okay, okay." 

Luckily, the old litter box is still in the dumpster. He set it up at the new apartment. 

"Come here, kiddo," His cat said. "Why do you call me kiddo? You are only eight years old." 

"If I convert to human age, I'm in my 50s. I am in the age of your dad."

"What? Fair. What's the magic of your litter box?" 

"You know, you humans like to follow us everywhere, except the litter box. It might be a litter box outside, but once I push the litter in a certain frequency, it will connect with our mother plants. Don't you humans have something like Tardis? Even I know Doctor Who. Fascinating material to learn human beings." He cat jumped into the litter box. All Owen hears is the cat started bury. The litter box shakes slightly and starts to glow some light, like every entrance in a cliched sci-fi movie.  

Owen put his head into the litter box; interestingly, it smells like spring, he can't imagine the such big space in the litter box. 

Owen woke up on the floor, his head seems hit by something, and his vision is blurry. The litter sand is everywhere on the ground. He is about to get mad because clearly, it's his cat's crime. His cat is purring and kneading on this chest while rubbing Owen with his forehead. 

"Fine, I will stay here a bit longer before I get up and clean your mess." Owen thinks.

Thank you for reading my lame story.

## Readings

In the first chapter, the author went back the history and introduced the history of VR. It keeps me wondering, the concept of VR and technology seems to appear so early, but the VR took this length of time to get more accessible by consumers. 

In a later chapter, he introduced the return of VR started with devices called Oculus Rift. Based on my limit knowledge and understanding, here are a few reasons I concluded: 

**Computing Power**

Since in VR headset, the left eye and right eye have to process separately. It requires the doubled computing power while there are very few GPUs that could match that. 

**Unrealistic View.** 

Steve Jobs brought the term "Retina Display" on the iPhone. The screen has to have enough resolution so it could be close enough to the eyes. There was no screen has enough detail to let the user immerse back then. The author mentioned the pixels and how that influenced the immersive of the VR. When I looked back at my iPad Mini First-generation, my eye is going to bleed. The pixel seems huge, and the screen quality is purely awful. But back the time, I was amazed by its screen when I first look at it. We didn't take that much of a long time to get here with a 4K, 8K resolution screen. We see the technology improves consistently. 

**Price of everything**

From lenses, chips. It costed a fortune to make them, but thanks to mass and automatic production and everything is cheaper.  
He gives a basic definition of VR: "To convince you that you're actually inside it." 

I feel VR, especially today. It's blocking you from reality. All of the current headsets are close to the eye and shaded the light outside the headset. So I don't think it's only one way of the user being convinced, but also the part the user so isolating out from reality, being forced to stay in the virtual reality. There is a block between reality and virtual reality. And it distinguished the Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality. 

It reminds me of the video Sally shared on a class about after the mom lost his daughter in South Korea; a company created a VR environment with her daughter so she could have closure and say goodbye.

Although it might fell into the medical field, under the most profound sorrow, will our brain alternate real and virtual? Can virtual reality do more things other than only entertain people? As the story of South Korea, the company used VR technology to heal the mom. Can we use VR technology to create diseases like autism, PTSD, or ADHD?
