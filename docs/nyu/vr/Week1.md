## Reading Response

I am definitely not aware of the history of Ethereal Cube; after I finished this reading, I googled more info about it. The earliest thing I know about VR in the 1960s was Sensorama, and it was introduced in 1962. The Sensorama is huge, immovable, and you have to stick your head into the machine.

Ethereal Cube is elegant, small (compare of Sensorma), although it definitely can't be wireless given the time was in the 1960s. The "Sword of Damocles" is a great name for it. Given its mechanical structure and hanging on the top of your head.

I found this video on Youtube.

But it - compare to Sensorma - is closer to the VR headset we use today like HTC Vive, Oculus Rift. 

I loved the place where scientists and inventors found inspiration like mentioned in the reading materials, the Sci-fi Movies and novels, examples like Wachowski's Matrix and Neuromancer. I was minored in Digital Humanities in undergraduate and most rewarding and fascinating when going back to history, looking at the things people imagined decades ago now all came true. 

The development of virtual reality boomed in the 2010s. I was lucky to experience most of the new devices growing up. I tried HTC Vive, Google Cardboard, and Hololens MR devices. At the end of the article, the author Mark Riboldi mentioned: 

> "Of course, whether it is using VR for the treatment of vertigo and PTSD, or drawing our attention to unconscious biases like racism, it is possible that VR does have the ability to change our perception of the world around us, that the knowledge we gain from this technology *can* be transformative."

I am working on becoming a physical therapist in the future. One of the examples I would love to explore is to use VR to treat Phantom Limb Pain. One treatment is using a mirror box to mimic the illusion to create after an amputation. Imaging we can do it in VR headset, by not creating the illusion, but create a real "virtual" experience to the patient. 

Technology can be transformative. I would love to dig into using VR in the fitness, kinesiology. We all love Ring Fit Adventure, it both used an intuitive to get people to start to exercise, also fun to play. So, where is our next Fitness game in Virtual Reality? 

Thank you for reading this.
