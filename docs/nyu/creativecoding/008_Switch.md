# Week 8 Coffee and Shake Switch 

Physical computing is a whole area for me. I know some of my crewmates from physical computing backgrounds, so I am a little bit worried that I might fall behind in this area. 

For this assignment, I create to switch. I like the first one, but it seems I didn't interpret the requirement operated without using your hand. You still need to put the coffee on the mat. 
So I created the second switch. This switch has the ball in the center of the cylinder; you can blow the ball side to side, and the different color LED will be light up. 

Here's my documentation. 



## Coffee Switch

A morning coffee could light up an LED. 

First I create the matt, which has + and - connect to the board. When the circuit connected, the LED will light up.

I have some tin soldering iron left from repair my old car cable issue. As well as some cable. So instead of using cable from the box, I ironed it on the board. 

The paper does not connect with iron really well, also to add up the surface could connect with the cup, I add some cable as well. 

Then I use some tape connect a loop of wire underneath my cup, so when place cup on the board, it will let up the LED. 

Here's final result.

## Shake Switch

Then I created another one for fun. 

This is a bowl contain both side of the aluminum foil, the bottom has + and both side is - and connect to different LED.

So when the ball touches one side of the cup, it will light up one side of LED.

Then if you shake the ball, it will connect with different side of LED.
