## Flappy Party Parrot

When I first saw the assignment requirement about the party, the first thing came to my mind is party parrot.

So I decided to do this Flappy Party Parrot for this assignment.

## Reading

I remember the first lesson of Communication 101 we learned "The medium is the message" by McLuhan. 

I never envisioned that someday the programming language could be examined using the communication philosophy until today. I especially love his explanations of "you have to become the medium if you use it." It is brilliant to compare how our brain processes the message and compare that to the object-oriented method. 

After reading this paper, few keywords stick to my head:  **polymorphism** and **encapsulation**. 

#### Polymorphism

How our brain treat overwhelmed information efficiently?

We categorize them. In a programming language, it is both categorize but leaves the ability to treat them in the individual context. In kindergarten, I learned fruit, which includes apple, banana, watermelon, etc. It's easier for us to remember and distinguish between fruit or vegetables. But we treat them all as fruit but also evaluate the item individually. 

When we talk about the diet, we need to eat more fruit, and we treat the fruit as a category. We don't need to care what kind of fruit or what fruit we need to eat, as long as it is fruit. In a programming language, it simplifies the logic and increases the productivity to deal with redundant computing. The same method and content are everywhere. 

#### Encapsulation

Reuse, expandability, and flexibility, 

Please allow me to explain the encapsulation using my own word. It helps me to understand it better. It means you don't need to know how this function works, what's inside it. You can just use it. 

We learned numerous formulas like calculating gravity and using G as universal gravitation constant back to high school mathematics or physics class. Until today, I still don't understand how G is calculated and the scientific method behind it. I just use it. When we think the complex mathematical problem like this, we simplify by using the formula, equation, functions. The equation is hiding its process and approaches, but we use it as a whole. 

Medium is the message; reversely, the message itself is another form of medium. This onion or Russian Doll-like structure interweaves itself. Since the object orientation has the same essential inherence, it is message, so it is medium. 



#### Where is the future? 

If we zoom out to a bigger scale, isn't a lot of modularized product similar to the intellection as object orientation? 

In Alt's paper, he defined the object orientation as: 

> "...For modeling highly complex system as smaller interacting elements that are finitely compuable." 

Motorola released its first modularized in 2016. It has a lot of different mods you can purchase later after you have the phone. They release their partners like JBL soundbox, Polaroid photo printer, Alexa smart speaker, and so many more.

Despite the reason behind it, the project dead after a couple of years, this product is still an excellent example of the mindset that came from object-orientation. But people who are designing modular phones always have the mindset of the object orientation.

For me personally, the mindset of OO means pack things for future reference and reuse. In the past, there is so many incidents I need some image, so I Googled it and downloaded it. I used itâ€”the end of the story. When there is next time I have to use similar photos, even the same one, the whole process begins again. Or I have a big PSD, maybe 2gig, and I just need one icon from this file. I use my laptop to open it, wait 2 minutes until it is loaded, and open it up, then use 5 seconds to export the icon from this document. If I create an icon pack for reuse proposes, I don't need to open the giant photoshop file to look after it. 

For me, this paper is like a time machine; also like a microscope to look inside those brilliant computer scientists. Unity and Unreal engine, now all is working on the modulized program language. Java, C++ is fairly new, but it will become past tense.  Will the future of programming be modular?
