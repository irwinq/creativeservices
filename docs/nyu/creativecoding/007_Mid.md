# Week 7 Mid-Term Project

[Visit here for the project](https://irwinchyi.github.io/push/)

I deviated from my original idea to create a fun, goofy game. 

My idea originated from recently watching Netflix show 13 reasons why a story about a teenage girl committed suicide after being bullied during in high school.

I personally have strong relations with verbal abuse. I remember during middle school and high school, everyone is so judgy. While we all might be the victim of verbal abuse, sometimes we might say the words we don't mean to and accidentally hurts our beloved one. 

This game is called PUSH. It gives a metaphor that when we were facing verbal abuse in our daily life, one of the best approaches to push it away. The game was inspired by a game we might all play before, Sokoban, and combined with old fashion maze game. You have to find a way out in the maze of the hurtful words.

For this game, I developed locally rather than use p5.js web editor because I have around 20 png files, and I make a modification of png files very often. After I finished my development, I uploaded all of my files to the Github.io repository to host the game. 

If I have more time, I am planning to add more individual elements to this game. Also, I wish to add a comment function so people could share the mean words they heard from their real life, then the machine will automatically generate those words, and it will refect the word in real-time. 

Another function I hope to integrated is for all users to click the resources, and it will lead them to the online resources. Currently, it is rendered as a whole and big pngs that it won't allow the user to click and go to the individual website.   

Finally, become an upstander when you witness any type of bullying and verbal abuse.
