# Week 11

I am experiencing some connection issue but eventually it works! 

I reused one of my previous canvas, the flappy party parrots. 

With this function working, I want to use both rotation or change the x position to the bird using analog input and switch. The issue is how to distinguish the button and the analog output. 

You covered it during class use to analog input but I'm very lost still after rewatch the recordings. I am going to rewatch and follow the steps again.

## Final Project Proposal 

In last couple weeks, I mentioned that I wish to make a scale could measure the weight of water, then calculate the water intake for you, as well as reminding how much water you drink. 

I am planning to purchase a load cells and also load cells amplifier from Amazon. Then I am going to combine the readings on the board, print it out to the digital screen so user could monitor it.
