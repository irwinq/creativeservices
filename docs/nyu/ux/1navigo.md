# Navigo ——  UX Project



## Final Presentation

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irwinchyi/imgbed/master/img/Navigo.001.jpeg)

I am going to share this question with you. 
Have you thought about how many things on one webpage are irrelevant? 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irwinchyi/imgbed/master/img/Navigo.002.jpeg)

We can always skim through it for us, but for blind users, they have to use a screen reader to go in one line by line. 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irwinchyi/imgbed/master/img/Navigo.003.jpeg)

So for today's presentation, I got to break down four into four different faces research, defy, prototype, and benchmark.
For Project Navigo, there are four research methods I use to collect insight interview direction storytelling. 

## Research Method

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irwinchyi/imgbed/master/img/Navigo.004.jpeg)

For Project Navigo, there are four research methods I use to collect insight: 

- Interviews 
- Directed Storytelling 
- Video Ethnography 
- Mental Model Mapping 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irwinchyi/imgbed/master/img/Navigo.005.jpeg)

I asked several questions that involve both qualitative and quantitative questions. 

First, I want to get to know what TTS they're currently using. How much content, read out loud, is irrelevant, and how much time is wasted on that. 

After that, I want to know how they find an optimized website for the screen reader. And when they find a new one. How do they share with another blind user in this community?

## Empathy Map

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irwinchyi/imgbed/master/img/Navigo.006.jpeg)

So based on their answer, I generated this empathy map. My interview said, "there is no way to avoid them." 
They often get stuck up on the pop-ups like: you have to subscribe to read this article or, you know, Flash content, which totally blocks the areas and they could not continue. 

They have spent a lot of time looking for an alternative, and sometimes they have to give up. This can be really frustrating and stressful, and it could be sad. 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irwinchyi/imgbed/master/img/Navigo.007.jpeg)

For the insight, let's review three power questions.

- How much time wasted on and how to avoid irrelevant content? 
- How they find website optimized for screenreader? 
- Where to share the resources found? 



## Problem Statement

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irwinchyi/imgbed/master/img/Navigo.008.jpeg)
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irwinchyi/imgbed/master/img/Navigo.009.jpeg)

There is currently no direct competitor because it's like a new market and an indirect competitor. There are different markets and target audiences. An indirect competitor likes reader mode on Safari or Chrome ad blocker and key keyword launchers.



![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irwinchyi/imgbed/master/img/Navigo.010.jpeg)

So before we continue, what is keyword launcher?

It is pretty self-explanatory is a picture of it; you press a key, and you'll find a related result, and the app is going to launch right away.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irwinchyi/imgbed/master/img/Navigo.011.jpeg)

For design guidelines, the fundamental design guideline has always be considered throughout the whole process.

There will be no cursor and mouse needed keyboard interaction only. I will have both high contract designs optimized for low vision users and minimal icon image use. Everything will be compatible with VoiceOver and JAWS. 

## Demo

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irwinchyi/imgbed/master/img/Navigo.013.jpeg)

Navigo is a bar for everything online. Packing all those features in one place seems huge and cumbersome, not really because everything runs automatically on the back end without users' intervention. 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irwinchyi/imgbed/master/img/Navigo.014.jpeg)

The product logic behind is when you paste a link, it will convert to a screen reader ready hassle-free page, we will copy and paste the image, and we'll do the OCR for you, and you can launch the website easily effortlessly with just single keystroke additional research results will be available to Google, and again to use PWA which means progressive web apps to be available throughout the whole platforms.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irwinchyi/imgbed/master/img/Navigo.015.jpeg)
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irwinchyi/imgbed/master/img/Navigo.016.jpeg)
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irwinchyi/imgbed/master/img/Navigo.017.jpeg)
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irwinchyi/imgbed/master/img/Navigo.018.jpeg)

The project logic behind it is when you paste a link, and it requests an accessible version of the website.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irwinchyi/imgbed/master/img/Navigo.019.jpeg)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irwinchyi/imgbed/master/img/Navigo.020.jpeg)

So you can see, led by is the New York Times, even here is still blocking you, and you have two cents for reading the times you have to input your email address. Then the final step on the mobile app is going to disable CSS and JavaScript.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irwinchyi/imgbed/master/img/Navigo.021.jpeg)
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irwinchyi/imgbed/master/img/Navigo.022.jpeg)

We're going to measure success rate time on tasks, search results, and navigation destination for a behavioral KPI, and also we got to use customer satisfaction survey, usability survey, and online promoter measure attitudinal KPI.
