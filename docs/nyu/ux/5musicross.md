## Persona

### **Aman**

Good morning everybody The Augmented Reality gaming space within the blind community is rather lackluster at this time. There seemed to be a need for a sound and haptic-based games that create gameplay to entertain not only the individuals of thee blind community but also the non-blind community in order to create an interactive gaming space for everyone. Here is where the idea for Musicross came to life, where users can explore multiple musical cultures from across the globe at the comfort of their fingertips and ears. 

*Introduce ourselves*

### **Aman**

For our persona we have Jack lee; he is a 30 yr. old man who currently lives in NYC. Jack has been fully blind since the age of 15 and he hold a masters degree in Media Management at NYU. Currently, jack is a radio broadcaster and an accessibility tech reviewer on Youtube. 

Jack is quite a multifaceted individual with a creative and open mind. He’s highly interested in cultures from around the world and entertainment such as music movies and games. However, being a huge tech freak, he is rather frustrated that the future of tech such as AR does not cater to the blind community at this time, which is why he wants to change that for the accessibility space in gaming and other forms of tech. He owns all the latest tech such as the Apple devices but he’d want to use all the features that they’re capable of performing. 

Now I will hand it over to Victoria to talk about our Research process.

### **Victoria**

As we moved forward in our process we came up with two ways of conducting research: 
Attitudinal using Ethnographic interviews: Interview with Gus
And Behavioral: conducting Usability Testing at a later date.
After our initial creation of the product we will need to test its usability. We will want to ensure that Gus is able to use manual keys to navigate through the application. We will also want to ensure that the integration of binaural sound and haptics will allow for the gameplay to be not only understandable but fun!

### **Victoria**

Our first way of conducting research was through an attitudinal ethnographic interview with our client, Gus. Our interview with Gus was very interesting and informative. We appreciated having his expertise so early in the process. 
We asked Gus: Do you like to play games? Gus used to love audio games [on his phone] but they’ve been taken off: [insert picture of Papa Sangre]. A lot of focus has been mostly on making sure productivity apps are compatible. He didn’t love this idea and instead would like something that is fun and keeps him occupied! We originally had the idea of making a virtual / AR card game but realized that , through talking to Gus, that there are accessible uno games out there and that our initial ideas were too cumbersome! Gus also mentioned that a lot of accessibility innovation within the last ten years was in response to lawsuits. We kept this idea in mind as we thought of our problem statement and solution because it tells us a lot about the current gaming space for Gus.He wanted to play words with friends but hasn’t done it yet but he thinks that would be fun. He would want to experience an escape room!Gus also told us that he loves to listen to music (he even showed us how to listen to music on his phone!) and that he loves TV and entertainment. We kept his love of music in mind when we created our solution.

### Aman

Thanks Victoria, Aman here again. 

When conducting a market analysis for games similar to our idea of the accessible friendly that were on the market, we could only count them on our fingers. 

As Victoria mentioned earlier, Gus used to enjoy playing the sound based game called Papa Sangre. The game has been described by the developer as a "video game with no video" — its environment was rendered exclusively in sound via binaural audio, processed on their using audio engine, which is why this game was so successful in the blind community. 

The other game that was similarly successful was called the nightjar, which was designed by the creators of Papa Sangre. In fact, this game worked so well that they even got benedict cumberbatch as one of the voiceovers. That said, this game has also been discontinued and is not on the app store anymore. 

Finally, we have Lost and hound, a Console game that is about a dog in a virtual world, where the user is mainly reliant of the binaural sound to complete the levels. Even though the game had an open-world style that is easier for a non-blind user, the blind users performed better on this game than non-blind, which shows us the importance of sound when it comes to gaming for the blind.

So what is currently on the market for the blind users? Well, console based games exist with certain features for the blind, however we wanted something more easy to use and access such as our phones that already offer us all these accessible features and connectivity. 

In fact, our original idea was to make AR based using general games such as Uno, Connect 4, Monopoly have accessibility features but as Gus mentioned the idea was cumbersome and already in existence with its accessibility features. This is why we took a more unique approach with Musicross by focusing on the portable elements of accessing the game with a strong focus on binaural sounds and haptic guidance for the user.

Now we will be playing a video from a Youtuber called the blind gamer, who is a partially blind individual. He reviewed the game the last of us pt II and in this upcoming video he explains the elements that allows for a non-sighted user to be able to play. This will show us the importance of sound in gaming and how it is essential when designing a game for our blind users.

### Victoria 

Thanks again, Aman. Victoria here. After conducting our additional research, including listening intently to that video by the BlindGamer, we swiftly realized that there were a few key features that needed to be integrated into our solution and addressed in our problem statement. Those features will be: feedback and navigation by using binaural sound, haptic feedback / guidance, ensuring that manual keys will be present to guide a user through the app, and most importantly a game that is fun!



## Personal Statement

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irwinchyi/imgbed/master/img/Final%20Pitch%20-%20Group%202-10.jpg)

How might we introduce a unique and shareable AR gaming experience for individuals within the blind community to experience and interact with music from various cultures around the world.

### Ariel

Thanks Victoria, this is Ariel speaking.

To solve this problem we have identified, we designed an AR game called Musicross for blind users which could also be enjoyed by everyone. This iOS based app allows users to virtually leave their own bubbles and explore different regions worldwide to learn about different cultures by musical gameplay. Users will be able to appreciate the world music & connect with each other even though they are physically apart. 

After opening the app, there will be a welcome page saying “Welcome to musicross” → Then we can use haptics to choose our destination & Irwin is going to demonstrate this feature now.

> This 3D Animation demonstration video is showing a phone is floating on a world map. The phone moves up and down. The front of the phone is facing and point towards different continents on the map.

When you enter the app, you will guide by audio cue to select the region of destination. Imagine you are standing in front of a world map, you move your finger and point at the countries/regions you want to go. Now with your phone, there is an imaginary map in front of you when you hold your phone. 

This feature is receiving readings from the iPhone's Accelerometer, with iOS built-in ARkit, simply move your phone around without looking at your screen. You will hear audio cues of which region you are currently hovering. You will get haptic feedback between different regions. Double tap the screen to enter. For our example, we are going to select North America, United States, and Hawaii. Back to Ariel. 



### Ariel

After entering Hawaii, there will be a welcome audio saying Hello in the region’s own language. Ex. “ALOHA! Welcome to Hawaii” 
Then we will listen to a short introduction audio about Hawaii’s music & history. As we enter the region, there will be a guidance clip of how to play the game.
There will be two modes of game play:
The first one is by tabbing buttons to play the instruments and the other is the AR mode.

For the button tabbing mode: 
Before starting to play the game, users can listen to the piece of the cultural music they will play along to
After the game starts, there will be 4 buttons representing 4 different percussion instruments and Each button will release an instrumental sound that has accompanying background music based on which region you are playing in. Users can create the beat by adding to the music in a freestyle manner. After it ends, the AI will calculate your performance by giving you a letter grade, more than C+ is a pass to the next level. and there will be 3 levels in total.
Now Irwin is going to demonstrate the AR mode for us

When you put your phone on the landscape mode, it will ask you if you want to enter AR Mode. 

It will give you an audio cue once it detects the anchor point. You can print anchor points by print out this paper very easily. With Apple’s AR Kit and iPhone 11’s wide front camera, the placement of the paper doesn’t need to be accurate. On the paper, you will have the same 4 same buttons as the regular mode Ariel was mentioned. If the diamond shape is compromised by any object, like your pen, even your finger. It will be triggered as a button is pressed.

### Ariel

For the feature prioritization, our team has designed the basic game format including the augmented reality component and the accessible and inviting interface. We have also identified the game play functionality using tabs and AR spacial awareness to represent the game play.

### Aman

In the near future, we envision Musicross to have a larger collection of musical elements from all around the world with a variety of instruments. We would like to integrate social platforms such as FB and Instagram for users to share their performance with their social communities. Additionally, we would want to have a feedback system for our users in built so we can focus on the important changes in future updates with our direct user feedback. We also envision a voice integration feature where users can sing along with the levels as an added feature to record their levels and sing along with the music. Finally, we would like to test these features with ability studies and then gather our user data to formulate our gameplay.

In the further future, we wanted to employ a Minecraft style idea by allowing users to create their own levels for the Musicross community to play. This adds a huge community element for users across the globe and can be implemented into the game when a larger repertoire of musical elements have been introduced for personalized level creation. Additionally, we would love to take this game onto the apple TV as well to create a more immersive experience across different platforms.

> Imagine Description:  Text, Victoria reads out. 

### Victoria

It is time that a significant development must be made within the gaming space for the blind community. This should not be restricted to generic games or even fully-fledged console gaming. Instead, we should focus on easy to access formats of gaming that can create community based elements of fun and new experiences at the comfort of your fingertips or ears.
