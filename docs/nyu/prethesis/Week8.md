# Week 8 

This week, I finished part of my **community** prototype. I was looking for the brand as an example to feature the basic rule of the weekly challenge. I picked MasterCard, then switch to **Amex** because there is more content create regarding those brands. 



- One brand each week 
- Incentives, If the brand is MasterCard, the incentives could be Gift Cards
- Each designer could pick their category and participate, and it does not limit the type of content that will be created. 
- An illustrator could draw a poster when advertising students could form the next successful Ad Campaign for them. 
- Everything could participate while everyone will be the judge 
- Each individual user could click, Up and Down. The down will not be calculated, but up will be count as the final score 
- The highest score will be the winner. 



Also, I wish to add another function called Designer Path Pal. This tool is used to solve a unique problem that I and all other online learners might face all the time. When I take an online tutorial on YouTube, it's impossible to remember all the steps and do it later, so I often find myself following the tutorial while building the content on my personal computer. 

If I don't have a dual monitor setup, I will have to switch back and forth, pause, and resume the content while participate by myself. I found this very annoying, and the spilled screen is usually a bad option because the software interface has been packed with all the different buttons you have to press. Designer Path Pal will be a plugin that you could install for most software like After Effects, Photoshop; when the content creator builds the tutorial and use the same plugin, it will record every step along the way so you could follow it inside the software like After Effects. 

Or, instead of recorded video, the lecture record the mouse click and movement so you could replay it on your computer. 

I did some research and found Adobe has its own learning solution called Adobe Captive, and you can design the content inside the software. But they don't have those kinds of software or plugin for their own software like Photoshop or After Effects. 

I hope by building this type of plugin and software, users could follow the problem and step-by-step tutorial easier, compared to right now that they have to switch back and forth a million times. 



## Add more illustration

Also, according to my friend who take a look of my design, he added a comment that I should add some illustration on my project. Here's some I found that I might use them.
