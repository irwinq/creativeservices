# Week 1 Exploration



## Research

**5 Examples** of Project I feel strongly about 

### 1. Designcode.io Education in combination of design / code

Designcode.io is an online tutorial website/subscription that combines design with programming. For a very long time, designers and programmers always seem on the different side of the river. It’s hard to build a product without thinking about both sides of the cards, both programming approachability and anesthetics. 
As a designer, I learned Swift UI, Code, After Effects, Figma, etc. I recommend this website to my programmer friends, and they are very benefiting from the design course for developers which teaching software like Sketch, Figma while speaking the language and thinking like a coder. 



### 2. Interactive Portfolio / Company Website, Example Bruno Simon's Portfolio

This portfolio / mini interactive website is from creative director Bruno Simon. In this mini-game, you could drive a mini trunk around and explore the environment. Using different 3D objects, he hides his work and his personal info sophistically. For most people’s portfolios, it is one-way interaction about the owner. In his portfolio, he made it not only interesting and interactive but also give you a free world to explore outside the map. 



### 3. Physical Therapy in Digital Platform, Injurymap, Past UI Design Project, adaPT

## Questions

**About Fitness**

Do you use any App to track your workout goal? 

Do you have any and currently using fitness tracking devices, like Fitbit, Apple Watch, etc? 

Have you ever follow exercise video, like Cardio, Strength? 



About Design

For very long time, as learner and designer, I feel very disoriented about where I could learn. Unlike something you could learn in college, motion design usually is one single course of After Effects 



## Some thoughts about the research 

I am worrying. For this pre-thesis class, I really wish I could dive in a big project that I am unfamiliar with. I am very interested in digital media and how that influenced physical therapy and exercise/fitness. But as a designer, I am afraid that the research I conduct falls into a completely different realm that I am not familiar with. 
So what are the final deliverables? Could it be a report? Does it need to be a designed website or app? 
I am looking forward to seeing how my classmate picked their research idea, and I might adjust my research idea and let it be more approachable.
