## Week 3

After week 3, I set my research goal and direction to find a better solution for designer education. It came with my personal experience and the feedback I received from my friends, coworkers, colleges who also in this industry. They all agree with me that we need to design software training from multiple places and not only limited to the school or university level. 

Here is some initial idea that I am thinking about my platform could do: 

- It should give the recommendation of class based on the path they pick; for example, if they pick 3D designer, there will not be content for web designer and only for 3D design software. 
- I hope it could upload your transcript or syllabus from the class you took before, so the system could automatically recognize the class you took before, then start to rule out a similar class. One issue I have been facing really often is the duplication of the content I have to take, and I noticed the tutorial might often talk about the content I am already aware of or fully practice. So I have skipped them many times. If there is a system that could help reduce the time wasted on those things. 
- I hope the platform could have a partnership with the university that students could transfer the credit they took here back to their university. 

**Stakeholders**

The platform will start free for student, then charge for a monthly subscription. That way we could keep the platform running longer.

Rethink Design Education

In my presentation, I talked about the design education system in the past and some potential problems we might be facing nowadays. 

As a young practitioner who has just graduated, I think it is **necessary to learn more professional knowledge** and skills to make myself more competitive. To become a good candidate, **the academic experience alone is not sufficient to a certain extent**. 
I believe that the dearth of practical experience is inevitable with the theoretical foundation in terms of my major classes. Therefore, in the job search and work environment, I often use **online course platforms**, such as Coursera, to enhance my professional ability under the combination of theory and practice to better adapt to the development of the industry.

**Issues**

Design Education Need to redefine relationship between theory and practice 

Design acts on the physical world and on the linked world of intangible

These projects, products, and services must meet the expectations of many organizations, stakeholders, producers, and users.

**Enhancing Practice** 

**Blind Recommendation / Or based on your preference, not career path 

You might already took the similar class, Duplicated Content

Suit for Coder / Programmer but not for the Designer
