**What is designer path?** 

Designer path is an online learning platform specifically designed for designers who need learn more to advance their careers. 



**Why is this necessary?** 

- Many designers reported that they need extended education to qualify for daily job assignment outside the college. While the online class has unlimited resources, it came with various quality and user need to spend times to find class suites for them. Additionally, some class has duplicated contents compared to their undergraduate academic training, and it might waste their time to retake it. 
- Unlike college experience with professors and teammates, online learning experience feels very lonely. Study with peers could be more beneficial so we created an online learning communities for different kinds of designers so they could communicate with each other. We also have weekly events with assignment and incentives to allow designers practice their skills. 
- Our platform hope to connect with advertising agencies, technology companies and their top-tier designers, content creators and share their experience with our platform users, with potential opportunities to have a conversation with their HR and join the company. 
- We hope to work with one or more universities to develop an curriculum that allows student transfer credit back to their four-year college. This allows any student who wish to take design class to get their college credits. 



**What other people done so far?** 

- Currently there are so many online learning platform for online learners like Coursera, Udacity, Udemy. Unfortunately those class doesn't provide a centralized, customized and targeted learning experience for designers. Especially the world biggest MOOC platform Coursera doesn't offer that much of content for designer tools like Adobe Creative Suites or Sketch, Figma, etc. 
- Recent years so many learning platform start to emerge for designers like Designcode.io, School of Motion, CG Shortcut. They often limited their content to certain kind of designer job. .
