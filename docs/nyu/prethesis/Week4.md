# Week 4



## Feedbacks

I am very glad that I received so many helpful feedbacks from my peers, through this week's process blog, I am about to address some feedback I received as well as the future plan of my project. Like where the next step is. 

Here's the feedback I received from my peers: 

> **What are some things that you (Myra) are learning from Irwin? **
>
> The project he is working on can be so beneficial for future designers - knowing they have a platform with industry professionals providing education.

Seems my project make sense to other design student. I hope my website / platform could really benefit other designer student or student from other background make a smoother transition to their dream careers. 

> **Does the prototype help you understand their project differently? How?** 
>
> Yes because of the wireframe visuals he provided, it gave me an idea of what the website/platform will look like; straightforward, easy to use and visually appealing. 

Currently, I am still work on my wireframe, and the prototype. While I know with current time limitation, I won't be able to build a website which actually work, I still hope I could have several pages build out and use prototype tools like Adobe XD or InVision so other peers could try out how the pages links together eventually. 

> **What are some feedback or recommendations that you would like to share with â–²?**	
>
> The prototype gives the look & feel of the project well for the landing page. Would be great to see the screens for the primary features of the project .

## Prototype

Past week and this week, I started my prototype and continue to make them better. Here's the current look of the landing page, I am not really satisfied with the look and I might have to redo everything to fit my project look. 

Here's the structure of the design, starting with the LOGO and navigation bar, following the brief information of the platform. I didn't have this prototype ready with the path you can choose from, but the next prototype will have a section, and user could pick different design path, they can pick the main path, as well as a second path as minor if they what do, the list might be: 

- Web Designer 
- UX Designer 
- Motion Graphics Designer
- Production Design
- Digital Designer

The list will be longer, so the user could decide what they want freely. Then next section will talk about some features related to website. Like you can upload your transcript and syllabus so it could rule out some class for you. 

I am looking forward to continuing to finish my prototype and let it be more realistic as possible. I also hope I could have time to conduct at least one usability test before the next presentation. Additionally, when we build stuff here, we need to have accessibility in mind for a broader reach of users. So the website should have a basic accessibility function like the high-contrast color option.
