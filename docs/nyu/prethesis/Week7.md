# Week 7

This week, I present my idea to the whole class as well as Scott joined us and give me serval feedback as well as resources to point to. 

Here's his feedback with quotation, and my feedback about it as well. 

> Central question: ‘what is the purpose of higher education?’ Your question **- bridging between university training & job training**
>
> Tandon Online - https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/departments/nyu-tandon-online[jessie.guyryan@nyu.edu](mailto:jessie.guyryan@nyu.edu) Jessie Guy is the director of Tandon Online and knows IDM well
>
> Digital Media Design for Learning - https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/degree/ma-digital-media-design-learningdigital tools for online educationhttps://steinhardt.nyu.edu/people/christopher-hoadleycan give insight into best practices for doing this (from a learner’s perspective)http://www.lucwhite.com/ lucwhite@nyu.edu designing a tool that helps scaffold knowledge - to be an active learner

Scott points out some outer resources at Tandon Online as well as DMDL at NYU Steinhardt, and I am planning to reach out to them and see if they have any available time for a quick interview. Also, I am going to add some questions I might want to ask those people. 

Scott also points out that my research plan seems very massive; I should think of something that could be built and accomplished in the next 9 months, not in the next three years. So here's some idea I am thinking: 

- I will still present the idea I had initially but let the user be the content creator 
- Community feature will highlight a bond between mentor-mentee relationship, the incentives from sponsorship 
- Each individual user could recommend the class in the main stream, and each could click up and down if they agree to the quality of the content 
- The video content will be more from the YouTube content creators instead of building everything from the beginning. 



## Questions I wanna ask

- What made Tandon Online different from other platform like Coursera, or Udacity? 
- What made Tandon Online different from In-Person Experience at NYU Tandon? 
- Does the curriculum difference from in-person class? 
- Will it be more career focused? 
- What the most competitive feature about Tandon Online? 



For DMDL at NYU Steinhardt

- For Digital Learning, what's biggest disadvantage? 
- For student more career focused, what the best approach? 
- Present my idea and platform and looking for feedback
