# Some Final Thoughts after Presentation

[Final Presentation](FPresentation.md)

## Few Final Thoughts

I understand my limitation and issue with the scale of this project, but I am glad I made it this far. I believe my efforts in research, prototype, design, and research set a foundation for a real thesis next semester. I couldn't agree more and appreciate more the feedback I received from everyone. They are extremely useful and also point out the biggest problem of my research, the scale, and feasibilities. 

Scott talked about the problem scale and scope that seems to replace people who create curriculum and efforts by advisors. And build those curricula will be such a huge effort, and it will be hard to find a way to automate the whole process. I hope to build the platform as a place that designers could post the tutorial they found useful online, and the system will recommend those classes to other designers as well. It could start with a mature industry professional's hand-pick tutorial first and see the response from future designers. They could share their opinion after taking it, and then the system could recommend it to more people. I guess the best way to approach this problem is to give back the control to the user, as well as the content creation. As designers or developers of the software/platform, our efforts and time will always be limited. I hope by let user to deceive what benefit them the most could keep the content flow. 

Additionally, Scott mentioned building a relationship between mentor and mentee. I was trying to do this, but I didn't add that to my presentation for time limitations. It might be an easier start as the foundation of the platform to provide people a place that they could bond with other designers. Often we learned a lot from each other. Still, building a community will not be an easy task, but the market here is fair empty. For example, as motion graphics designers, there is some form that I could visit, but with a lot of click-bait ads and the user interface looks awful. Some people use Facebook groups, and some people use Reddit, but there is never a centralized place for designers to have a place to exchange conversations. 

Amy linked great research, and that's exactly what I am thinking about tutorials that could be integrated into real-time applications. I guess another issue why it is taking too long and so rare people seeing those tutorials because they are so hard to make. There are no tools for that, and we can see most people share and create tutorials by simply record their screen. It's both quick and easy to use. If there is a program that could record each mouse click, keyboard type and match them with a voice-over, it will create a better tutorial that won't be web-based; it will be open inside the application in such an immersive way. It is definitely worth research. 

I am looking forward to continuing my research this summer as well as limiting down and scaling down my project. Elizabeth gave me a real big question about the devaluation and inflation of college degrees and worth digging into. But I could see many colleges adjust their curriculum and encourage the student to participate in programs like a co-op for more real-life internship experience. 

Finally, I hope to interview my industry professionals, as well as Digital Learning at NYU; with help from multiple sources, I am confident that I could push my current pre-thesis project to the next level. 

Thank you for your amazing class and semester-long great feedback. 



## Feedback I received in-class

### Dan

> Dan: Would be good to understand the conversation around spec work and how “challenges” might be received - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculative_work / https://www.nospec.com/

### Scott

> **Scale and Scope**
>
> What you’re proposing is very great, but is a massive platform.Your project is starting to sprawl out beyond what you can feasibly accomplish within the scope of the next 6 months / fear is that you might not reach the goals you are trying to aspire to.What is the singular most important thing in your project that you want people to walk away with?	
>
> **Irwin**: depends on feasibility. I don’t want to provide the class; I want to provide the algorithm that pulls classes, and try to figure out what you should take. I know it sounds massive, but the end goal is to give people a more personalized, individualized curriculum gathering everything online. 
>
> Even just aggregating content and giving curriculum to people is a massive undertaking! 
>
> Trying to navigate and find that pathway for people is a really great thing… but I have a really hard time finding a way how you would automate this.
>
> Something else to consider is that a mentorship is often a better path than straight up more coursework.

### Elizabeth

> Devaluation/inflation of experience and degrees is a real problem: presentation started with a personal frustration (shared by people) -- the inflation of expectations of experience of degrees; the devaluation of degrees	
>
> Part of this is the proliferation of online platforms that aim to provide credibility of experience. As you mentioned, that’s a super overwhelming space. 
>
> There’s a lot of competition.	
>
> Question: if the thing that you’re pushing back against is the proliferation of platforms, is making another platform the solution?https://xkcd.com/927/Some interesting sources of inspiration: completely alternate models of education; what are alternative forms of sharing knowledge and learning, being with people to learn things together?
