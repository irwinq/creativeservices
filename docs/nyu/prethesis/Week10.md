# Week 10



This week, I continue my research with my usability test. To do a better usability test, I created a list of tasks and a couple of questions to ask the user. I also generate a map of the website to help me better navigate the design. For the final presentation, I have been giving the pieces of advice that I should create one clear timeline for one career path to let the viewer see how it looks like, so I created a user path as motion graphic designers and class it needs to take.

For my usability test, I decided to ask two of my friends to complete the usability test. First, they have been giving question like 

- What do you think about the overall design of the website? 
- Do you think it easy to find all the functions you want on the website? 

Later, I asked some specific task like: 

- Could you find the task for becoming a web developer? 
- Could you find the path for becoming a motion graphic designer? 
- What kind of class do you need to take to become a motion graphic designer? 

This kind of question could make sure the user understands the structure of the website easily, and they won't be confused by the website. 

Also, there will be some general questions like? 

- Will, you recommended this website to other people? 
- Where do you think it could be improved for both design and functional purposes? 

Currently, I am finishing my website. Once it's done, I am going to send it over to my friends and conduct this usability test. 

I am very excited about the final presentation for this project I work so long. Also, I wish to write a document to explain the reason behind the website and give the reader a better understanding. 

I don't think my website will provide a replacement of higher education because it's completely different purposes. I hope my website could be used for those who need to switch their career path or those interested in the designer career but don't have enough class to come with it.
