# Designer Path

For my research / final project, I wish to create an app/website could help designer find their path in their career advance journey, there is significant why I think it is important and this topic is interesting to me. Before that, I would love to share some stories from my friends and me about their journey. 

One of my friends, A, was major in a completely irrelevant major compared to any kind of design, but she really enjoyed the look of great user interface and UX design. So she switches to her major to design. At the beginning phase of her journey, she feels really lost because she doesn't know what to do. She knows a little bit about designers, but she couldn't distinguish the UI designer / UX designer / Product Designer, and she wasn't sure about the path she might take. 

Secondly, once in the class, everyone already knows Sketch / Figma. Since she came from a different major, she has no idea about those tools and feels lost. She was wondering where she could find some online resources that allow her to learn more about this industry. 

For most complete beginners in this area, they might find them really hard to catch up with speed. While everybody else is moving on quickly, they might feel left behind and don't where to start. 

I hope to create an individualized path for anyone like her who feels lost when they new to this field.
