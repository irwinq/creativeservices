## Refined Storyline

Owen is a senior student major in Communication Studies who is really interested in UX design and research. 

He picked his minor in Graphic Design so he learned some basic color theory and Photoshop through the classes. During his past three years of undergraduate studies, he rarely learned anything about UX design because his curriculum doesn’t have those, nor had any internship related to this topic. Now he is looking for an internship for 2021 summer, he noticed a lot of job description requires a certain levels of familiarity of UX design and UX design software. Since he doesn’t have any experience, he found himself very passive in the current job market, and he also wish to know people with UX design experience to learn from them. 
He found this website called designer path could help him be more prepared to be a UX designer. The website provides several different career paths for Owen to pick from, also provides overlap between the different paths. He wishes to be a UX designer but also hopes to learn some Motion Graphic Design in UX work. He picked the UX designer track on the website and selected Motion Design as an elective track. 

During his undergraduate study, he already took several design classes like color theory. Using a website build-in function called full out, first he uploaded his transcript to the website. The website recognized it automatically and rolled out all classes related to the media theories because he already took it. Some of the class he took for his minor Graphic Design has been applied to the learning journey. The website recommended several class like color theory and Introduction to Sketch and Figma. After the first trial class, he could pick the like or dislike button. If he picked dislike, the website would be recommended other classes in this category but taught by a different lecturer. He added a few classes he is interested in, like Unity and 3D design, which is not part of the career path he chose as an elective. After finish the whole track has a participation class with NYU, he received a transcript from NYU with As. He transfers a couple of college credits back to his University as electives. 

He also use the community function to ask people who are in the industry about feedback on his work. He received many useful feedback and also about how to enhance his career. A couple month later, he used his UX prototype found his first internship at a local technology company. 



## How do we measure success?

For most websites, it could calculate by traffics and how many people stay after a certain amount of time. Those quantities measurements could tell if this website is a good business model or not based on actual numbers that could be count. 

On the other hand, I like more qualitative measurements like a survey or direct interview with the user. This method could allow me to understand the logistic behind the user psychology and find more points to improve in the future. 

### Interview Question

- Do you think this website is beneficial in your career path? 
- Would you recommend this website to your classmate, peers or friends? 
- Do you found useful skill you wish to learn in this website? 

I wish to use those specific interview to measure the outcome of user. 

### Outcome Goals

- User learned from the classes 
- User advanced its careers 
- User found class helpful

After all those survey, we could ask user what is missing in the process. We could also visit other website and compare a rating system on the scale from 1 to 10. This method could find out which platform user is more preferred and modify our platform along the way.
