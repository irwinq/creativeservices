# Week 5 Process Blog

This week I received so much beneficial feedback during the 1 on 1 with Professor Taeyoung; here's some feedback I received. 

> Awards/projects; you submit through work or through school, but not as individuals. Itâ€™s hard for individuals to get feedback and have individual work judged.
>
> College to have collective feedback; e-learning experiences is solo - no TAs, no feedback, etc.

I will expand on two topics here more because I am going to include those two ideas in my projects later.

The first one is learning with incentives. I am going to do more research and see how educators' opinions about the incentives. But I believe incentives could draw more participants to my website and might be really beneficial for the website traffic. 

I am going to create a separate page for my website, which is called weekly challenges; each week, there will be different design topics all different designers could incorporate this topic into their design. Potentially, it could be featuring a certain brand and design for them, so the brand could sponsor the incentives and participate in the judgment of the challenges. Each week, there will be one winner and one honorable mention, both of the winners will be awarded either gift cards or other things sponsored by brands. 

The winner will be a vote by all viewers who participate in these challenges, and the honorable mention will be chosen by staff or sponsor-brand side. Different designers might have all different techniques to deal with these challenges. For example, graphic designers could design a poster, then motion designers and 3D designers could design short animations. 

The second idea is about building a community. For a lot of content we learned online, we learned alone and hoped we could talk with our virtual classmates and could ask them some questions. 

I wish the community could form a mentor-mentee relationship between our future designers and leaders who already in the industry, like creative directors and HRs. I bet this channel will be a better solution for HRs found next great designers. In the design industry and advertising world, I believe the experience is very important and the learning abilities. 

I had a conversation with my boss when I was an intern for an advertising agency, and we talk about the software are consistently changing and updating in recent years. There will always be new content that came out and replace the old one, so as designers, we need consistently learning the stuff every day. Here is the reason why I believe this could come in very handy. My platform provides a place for long time career advancement and learning that not only benefit the student but many people who already in their position. 



## General Design Curriculum

Here is some example about the curriculum that I talked about. I hope to design each individual path with different difficulties, like of curriculum in college that you have pre-requirement. But instead of pre-requirement, the general electives will be skippable here. There will be there different tiers of class. For example, as Motion Graphic Designer, the tiers will be:  

Stage 1: General Design, Design Foundation, Basic After Effects Theory 

Stage 2: More After Effects Class, Motion Graphics Foundation, After Effects Principles in Motion Graphics Contents 

Stage 3: After Effects Plugin, Cinema 4D related content
