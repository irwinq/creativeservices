# Lights in Interior Rooms

Here's three image I picked. 

## Train Tunnel 

### Keyword: Function Light

I took this photo somewhere in the MTA train station. I can't remember which station, but I believe it is a very interesting place to see how lights affect the interior scene. The whole area is illuminated by the lights from the left side. Because it is such a long tunnel, it is hard to see what is the end of the tunnel. Still, you can see some lights in the end. Since it is an underground location, all lights here are artificial and have no natural light. 

Sometimes I feel that mimicking the artificial lights is easier to do so in 3D rendering, but sometimes I feel the difference. I saw a couple of examples of the 3D interior scene without any skydome or physical sunlight; just the area light still looks like natural lights. 

## Gym

### Keyword: Combination of Function Light and Natural Light

I picked this photo because the lights in this scene are very complex. There is multiple very reflective surface like a mirror. Then some surfaces like the ball, and the surface of the bench, even barbell. You can see the many surfaces are influenced by artificial lights, which are the lights set by the gym and natural lights coming in from windows.

There are huge LED lights on the left side on the top of the mirror. The lights from that LED are boosted by the mirror under it. Overall, this scene has too many reflective things, making it a great example to learn how light works in the real-world environment. 



## Cubes

### Keyword: Combination of Aesthetic Light and Function Light

The last photo I picked for this assignment is from Brookfield. It seems there are some events about to happen, but it hasn't started yet. There is no natural light in this environment because everything is indoor here. The floor surface is very reflective, and you can see the inverted reflection of every small light cube on the ground. The lights here are functional, which helped light up the whole area, but also aesthetically appealing. Additionally, you can see how those tube is being hung from the top of the scene.
