# Week 1

## Share Something Random Before Starting 

Hello and welcome. Sorry, I have to leave early last class for my doctor's appointment, and it went great. I am very excited about this class because I had prior experience in Redshift and Octane, as we discussed in class. But as a motion designer and the majority of the time working in After Effects, in the 3D world, I care more about dynamics, animations, and models. So in my past experience, I barely need to create lighting or material for my own. 99% of the time, I grab material from the material preset pack and grab a light present from the lighting pack. I feel pretty stupid. Keep using this shortcut, so I feel it will be a perfect chance to learn them from scratch. 



## Lighting in 3D Animated Film 

Speaking of lighting, the top two 3D animation film jump in my head is the Soul and Coco both by Disney. The lighting in Soul is trying to create the scene of an after land with the contrary of attempting to mimic the real-world lighting of streets of New York City. 

Here's the trailer of the Disney Movie Soul.

Instead of Soul, the movie I feel is most sophisticated, using lighting to express the emotions, is Coco. I feel my classmate might also choose this movie because it's such an emotional movie with great soundtracks and narratives. Still, I pick Coco because the lighting not only helps you separate the living and death and match the tone of the storyline and enhance the expression of the emotions through environmental lights.

In this scene, Miguel is singing to his mama coco; Miguel is worrying that if mama coco forgets Hector, he will be gone forever in the Land of Death. 

The light is single environmental light with a dark red/orange tone, and it mimics the real-world sunlight across the window that Mama Coco sits next to. Usually, the red/orange tone stands for warm, cozy feelings. It has been using in a situation like family scenes or couples in love. In this scene, the orange environmental light conveys warmth and matches the whole movie tone of the events on Halloween. Also, the single source of sunlight also stands for hope; after Miguel sings the most famous song in this movie, "Remember Me." Mama coco sings the song along with him with warm sunlight behind her. Finally, Miguel found the photo of Hector, and now he won't be forgotten nor disappear.
