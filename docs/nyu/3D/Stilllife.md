## What I Picked?

### Painting Still Life with Roses and Fruit

#### 1863, Henri Fantin-Latour, French, from [MET Collection](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/436292?searchField=All&amp;sortBy=Relevance&amp;what=Paintings&amp;ft=still+life&amp;offset=80&amp;rpp=20&amp;pos=96)

## How did I model things?

I couldn't find the model online, or the model I found online was too expensive, and I am not ready to spend that amount of money. 

I don't wish to spend too much time modeling, so I didn't use Maya to model my objects. I am unfamiliar with modeling in Maya. To make things done quickly and I could spend more time on material and lighting. I decided that I was going to use Cinema 4D to model stuff. 

So I modeled my own glass cups, although it is not very close to the original one. For grapes, I found a free model online, and it doesn't come with texture, so I prepared to recreate texture using Arnold.

Lastly, I found this pear on Quixel Bridge, and I didn't modify the modeling of the pear.

## Lighting

I created two lights, both area lights. 

Also I created two cups, the cup is too transparent so I doesn't cast enough shadow. I created another cup, made it invisible in Arnold, but it cast more shadow. 

I have one warm light from the left side

One cooler light from the right side

## What new stuff did I learn from this assignment? 

- Be more confidence in my modeling skills
- Create Glass Using Arnold, change the attributes
- IOR of the glass is 1.5 to 1.7, the IOR of the Water is 1.333333
- Use subsurface, it let my grapes looks more natural 



## Where did I learn from?
