## Inspiration and Random Thoughts...

I was born and grew up in the city, but my father was born in a small village in China's north. Where people used to live in something called yaodong or "house cave"

It used to symbolize poverty and lag behind. But I've been there a couple of times, and the cave house is actually pretty comfortable to live in here. Because rock and mountain preserve the heat and cold, so when it's cold outside, the cave house is very warm. When the weather is toasted outside, the cave house is way much cooler, and no AC is necessary. 

Living in the midwest for almost five years and moving to the coast was a big change where people called where I lived "middle of nowhere," But sometimes I very miss the mid-west because I could spend my whole afternoon reading near the lake or go Kayaking.

I just had this nostalgia and love of nature, and being slightly overwhelmed by my thesis and finals. Where this song is playing in my head. 

> I'll be there with your family if you make your way upstate
>
> There's a lake I know
> I know
> In a nearby park
> I'd love to go
> You and I can go when the night gets dark
> I will try to get away

So I miss the mountain too. So this assignment, I incorporated the yaodong and mountains, creating a space where I am very close to nature. The space itself is where I hope I can live if I am in daydreaming mode.

## What I learned from this assignment

- A good file name naming habit is important, especially dealing with big scene, there are too many different material and easy to get confused.
