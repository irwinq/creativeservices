"You are being watched; the government has a secret system, a machine spies on you every hour and every day." This TV Show, created by Jonathon Nolan, was a reflex of real-life PRISM. 

It introduced a machine called Machine, fed by all CCTV cameras and microphones. It could have access to, monitor, and spy everyone, and looking for potential threats to the country. The benefit or opposite of surveillance camera still debatable, still, this TV show served as precedence to discuss massive surveillance, which reflects every resident and citizen. 



## Surveillance Camera

This is the first book I would like to use in my essay.

Eyes Everywhere: The Global Growth of Camera Surveillance. [Through NYU Libraries](https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/lib/nyulibrary-ebooks/reader.action?docID=957252)

This book introduced how different countries install, design, use modern technology of surveillance cameras. The author of this book found several very interesting examples from different countries like Japan and Brazil. It also discussed the placement of the camera where I am going to compare with placement in China. It separated different locations with different levels and required various video quality, video storage time, and whether it directly sent the video feed to the police department. 

[Can Video Surveillance Systems Promote the Perception of Safety? Evidence from Surveys on Residents in Beijing, China](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/11/6/1595)

Another paper conducted research and large-scale survey in Beijing, China was trying to found out if camera surveillance could actually promote the scene of safeness in city's residents. According to this research, the group of people who might be most vulnerable to criminal conduct in public space like women is strongly agreed that public surveillance promotes public security. 

[Mass Media Law](https://www.mheducation.com/highered/product/mass-media-law-calvert-kozlowski/M9781260514513.html) has a chapter of intrusion and pricy has clear evidence that there is no pricy in public which is the biggest argue point about surveillance cameras. 



## Law Enforcement and Technology

Here are two examples I would love to incorporate into my essay. 

The first one is technology and law enforcement; unlike the United States, most traffic tickets in China are issued automatically by the surveillance system and speed radar on the screen. The surveillance system is highly efficient, sometimes even make a mistake. It does not only detect speeding or running a red light; it also could detect drive action like using a cellphone on the road or driving without a seat belt on. One example is one man who likes to hold his hand near his ears during driving, then the automatic camera captured it and ruled it as dangerous driving activity. He received several fines with that. 

People also find a different way to get away with an automatic system, on Taobao - the Chinese largest E-commerce website - the T-shirt with "built-in seatbelt" was very popular to get away with the surveillance camera. Technology also uses as a way to deal with police and state petrol in the United States. Wize maps or Google Maps has the function to tag on the map that there is police on the highway to warn the speeding drivers to slow down and avoid getting caught. On the one hand, technology could enhance a proper law enforcement process like the chest camera equipped as standard for most police officers; on the other hand, it could give people a creative way to get away with punishment and find a loophole. 



## Game Censorship, ESRB Ratings

The curation object I picked is the Netflix Black Mirror Episode 

### Black Mirror S04E02 Arkangel

Compared to massive surveillance, this episode of Black Mirror discussed the surveillance technology using by parents and their children. Parental surveillance technology is not new for us; currently, most phone and gaming system like Nintendo Switch and iOS has built in function of parental control. This episode envisioned a world that went to an extreme where the control system could control children's vision and hearing with a simple app. The mother in this show, using kids monitoring, overprotect its daughter, ends up losing her. 

In the history of Chinese Internet growth, there is one story behind and forgotten, is about a software called Green Dam, Protection of Best Childhood. Is a software could detect any type of pornography, or violence information on the Internet and block them. The government require all computer manufacture to install this software before the hardware shipment to the client. Soon, so many the voice against it push it back. 

[Does Censorship Really Protect Children?](https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1313&context=fclj)

Children learn so much from the game, sometimes even violent behavior. Here's another topic I might include in my essay but no sure. Usually, the game company, especially online game production like Blizzard, and Riot will release different versions of video games in China. Like League of Legends or Overwatch, even World of Warcraft. It will remove any blood or Skull-related content. So I am planning to discuss the game rating system and how it proved beneficial, which many countries have game censorship definitely needs.
