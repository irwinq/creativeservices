# Control and Surveillance on Screen, Movie and TV Shows

::: tip

At this stage, my curation has limited to the topic to control and surveillance, but I might need to expand further for my synthetic paper. Still, all examples will draw from movies or TV shows, mainly Sci-fi shows. 

:::

Control and surveillance are not an old topic for the sci-fi world. For two decades, so many TV shows or movies have explored different versions of the future world, from horror utopias like the movie Hunger Games, or a huge artificial intelligence is going to control the human race like I, Robot and TV Show Person of Interests. 

The conflict has always been the center of the drama; usually, conflicts are from people and the higher up control. The conflict could occur between people vs. evil AI, people vs. government. But all conflicts share the worry of centralization of the power, abuse of surveillance, or invasion of privacy. 

This curation project gathered a couple of TV shows or movies that discussed control and surveillance. Further down further in this assignment, I might discuss topics like networks and artificial intelligence.

### The Truman Show

Released in 1998, The Truman Show unprecedently discussed the real and worrying of losing freedom. It used a strange, bizarre storyline that introduced the journey of Truman's breakout from the director playing god.  Although this show wasn't directly talking about surveillance and control, it created a beautiful fake life to represent imbalanced life between public and personal privacy.

### I, Robot 

I, Robot, raise the warning of artificial intelligence believe the human race need put under regulation. It discussed the machines have their own consciousness, and it will further believe the human race is acting in chaos and need better control. It also gives people the conflicts between order and freedom by asking every audience how to balance between them to maximize the interest of the whole human race.



### Dystopian

The best example to discuss the control will be the utopia turn into dystopian. Those there movies and TV shows shared a very similar background and narrative sets, and all there was adapted from original novels. Their storyline seems very similar, and the world has been divided into different tiers; the undepressed tiers have, under pressure, finally start to fight. The dystopian movies argue for a free, less regulated world and opposite separation between different classes. 



### Person of Interest

"You are being watched; the government has a secret system, a machine spies on you every hour and every day." This TV Show, created by Jonathon Nolan, was a reflex of real-life PRISM. 

It introduced a machine called Machine, fed by all CCTV cameras and microphones. It could have access to, monitor, and spy everyone, and looking for potential threats to the country. The benefit or opposite of surveillance camera still debatable, still, this TV show served as precedence to discuss massive surveillance, which reflects every resident and citizen. 



### Black Mirror S04E02 Arkangel

Compared to massive surveillance, this episode of Black Mirror discussed the surveillance technology using by parents and their children. Parental surveillance technology is not new for us; currently, most phone and gaming system like Nintendo Switch and iOS has built in function of parental control. This episode envisioned a world that went to an extreme where the control system could control children's vision and hearing with a simple app. The mother in this show, using kids monitoring, overprotect its daughter, ends up losing her.
