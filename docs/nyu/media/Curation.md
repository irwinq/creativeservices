# Cybernetics in Games (Open World Games / Semi-open World Games / MOBA etc)

Cybernetics could be use to interpreted so many aspect of video game and the behavior of playing vide games. 

> Video games are games upheld by a machine that creates a cybernetic loop with its interactor. The machine is in charge of establishing and executing the rules of the game, that are inscribed within the code that it hosts and runs.

In Cybernetics, the player could be the first step of the sensor. The game gives instruction or graphic stimulations, and then players need to take action. The player's action will be Comparator. 

For example, if the player is playing a tennis game, the tennis ball's component kick starts to fly to the left side, the player would control the game characters' need to the left side and hit back. The Comparator has the logic and it governing the syinem to the right direction. In the other world, it is the core of gameplay play, and the player's performance contains sets of instructions to the game. The game excuse the players' order; the game characters run to the left side and hit the ball. The result of this not only lets the player know he hit the ball successfully but also back to the beginning phase of the loop. 



## Game Examples

| Minecraft                                                    | Hollow Knight                                                | League of Legends                                            | Overwatch                                                    |

| Positive Feedback                                            | Negative Feedback                                            | Both Positive and Negative Feedback                          | Both Positive and Negative Feedback                          |

In the book Roles of Play, the author introduced the brief cybernetics and how games utilized positive feedback and negative feedback. 

> Positive Feedback leads to divergent behavior: Indefinite expansion or explosion or total blocking of activities. Each plus involves another plus, there is a snowball effects.

While open-world games don't have goal settings to regulate players' behavior, they enhanced several positive feedback mechanisms to augment the outcome and the multiformity of the game experience, such as the video game Minecraft a great example of positive feedback. The variety of block material and tool selection gives the player infinite possibility to arrange each block in different locations. Each block or game item has a far-reaching linkage in between. In the beginning phase, the player could chop the tree to get wood. Then use wood; the player could chop it down to stick, wooden swords, wooden ax, and so many more items. Once the player gets the item, it increases the flighting capacity against the monster in the game and gives play opportunities and access to more maps and places. 

On the other hand, the Negative Feedback stable the game and move to the foreseeable outcome. One of the great examples, also a great game, is Hollow Knight. While the player could do whatever they want and explore the map freely. The game mechanisms give a clear goal and let them discover. In the game, there is a mask that served as health points. The player needs to find several mask shards. The journey requires in-depth game engagement and reveals the storyline behind the game.  

> Negative feedback leads to adaptive, or goal-seeking behavior: sustaining the same level, temperature, concentration, speed, direction.

In a more complex game like League of Legend or Overwatch, the game mechanisms get way much complex and introduce positive and negative feedback. In the book Roles of Play, Marc LeBlanc set down the relationship between feedback system and game mechanisms: 

> - Negative feedback stabilizes the game. 
> - Positive feedback destabilizes the game. 
> - Negative feedback can prolong the game.
> - Positive feedback can end it. 
>
> (Salen and Zimmerman)

In the League of Legends or Overwatch, players could play hero or champions has different skillset and attributes. As negative feedback, each character's skills and attributes will be balanced so no one will be overpowered. It stabilized the game and allowed space for individual performance. In the gameplay, the mechanisms like buff, neutral creatures in the game will give players or their team incentives in a different way to achieve the goal of expanding the advantage. By promoting the snowballing effects, it decrease the stability of the game, decreases the time of gameplay, and lets it end sooner. Allowing it to have a clear winning side.
