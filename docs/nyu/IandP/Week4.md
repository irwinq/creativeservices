## Process

This is a very interesting assignment, and I enjoyed it very much. It gives me a new perspective to view the things I used virtually every day and make it do something tangible. 

Part of my job, I have to detail with 3D render software named Cinema 4D. 3D design and renderings usually take a huge amount of time. So for daily 8 hours work, maybe 7 hours I spent on this software. 

When I learned about this assignment's detail, I have no hesitation but to choose this software. For a couple of reasons: 

I love this software because...

- Efficiency, very easy to learn 
- I know how to use it, and this is how I feed myself
- Something I use very often 

I hate this software because... 

- It always crushes somehow 
- I still don't know how to use it; it takes a very long process to master it 
- Something I use too often 

I started drawing stuff on the stock papers, the basic navigation bar, the properties windows; I am trying to mimic the real UX of this software. 

After I finished most things I need to draw, I started to make 3D cubes and other objects. I have serval cubes, one cylinder, one sphere, and one torus.

Cubes and cylinders are not very challenging. The most difficult part is the sphere and torus. Since those two have curves, it's not easy to do it using stock papers. So I have to cut the paper into small blocks and glue with step by step.

Finally, I have everything ready; I use Dental Floss to hang everything underneath the kitchen countertop. It sounds very easy but actually not. It's hard to put them into some level.

I used my DSLR shot photos and used Photoshop to remove the dental floss, so the image will look cleaner. 

Those cubes, my inspiration is from Legos. I was a huge Lego fan when I was a kid, and I still love it. Or the game: Minecraft. The linkage between those two: the fundamental thing of one 3D objects are little cubes.

Now we have 3D printers, and we can print 3D stuff easily. But if there is 3D software in the VR headset, will it looks something like this?
