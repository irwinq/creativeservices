# Week 7 Time Capsule Part 1

I know this assignment should be posted on social media. I am planning to post it on my Instagram story since it will disappear after 24 hours. I am going to put my story and narrative here as backups. 

Time Capsule should be something personal, maybe like diary that you are talking to yourself, right? So this assignment I am going to have a looser tongue (honestly its my perfect excuse to not to check my grammar errors). And keep everything personal. 

### Identity 

What's your name? Who are you? What do you do? 

When we introduce ourselves, we have so many different identities. We are someone's son or daughter; we are or were a student at a certain university. There is always a particular identity you are pound of saying that. It could be past tense, and you miss that identity tag. 
The identity tag I miss is this:

I miss the situation that I know every resident on my floor. I could watch football with them every gameday. I told them that DO NOT drink alcohol on my watch (they still drink beers, and I busted them several times). I miss my resident always give me a big hug when he saw me. 

When I first tell my dad that I got the job as RA. He questioned me, "For them, you are a foreigner, you are not a native English speaker, can you manage your follor well? Can you handle all those troubles?" 

Yes, I handled all those troubles. 



### Rehabilitation

- Anatomy 
- Strength Training and Conditioning 
- Dumbbells (Barbell is too big to fit here,right?) 

- Resistance Band

Rehabilitation is part of my life, and I am going to let it be part of me. 

Here's a copy of part of my personal statement and cover letter. I feel I explained better there. 

> For me, accessibility research is not simply an interest, with my own disabilities, it’s a
> subject that hits close to home. After surviving a massive accident and seven surgeries, I
> spent several years in a wheelchair with a long rehabilitation journey. This accident
> didn’t knock me down but sparked my interest in exploring the subjects of rehabilitation
> and accessibility.
>
> Currently, in additional to my studies at Tandon, I am working on intensive academic
> training on muscle anatomy, kinesiology, biomechanics and exercise science. I aspire to
> blend my designer instincts with knowledge I have learned. Additionally, I would plan to
> bring a whole new perspective to the Ability Project by standing at the intersection of
> design, technology, physical therapy and accessibility.

#### Goals for myself 

- Never complain the pain to your friend, keep positive attitude. (And it's okay to complain the pain to my best friend, and to mom)
- Go to workout as often as you could, strengthen weak knees 
- Go to sleep on time (This is hardest one on this list)



### Digital Photo Frame 

Photos are the must-have in the time capsule, right? 

While I could print out the photos and put inside here, why not just put my digital photo frame?  

I will put this devices into my time capsule.

| Me and my cousin                                             | Graduation Day                                               | the U.S. Healthcare is so different, $15000 bill.            |

Behind every picture, there are stories. This devices sits on my kitchen top for very long time. Every time I pass it, it reminds me a new story. 



### Guanine

My cat deserve a spot in my time capsule, his name is Guanine because I was a biology nerd in high school.

He is still in China with my parents, I will either save in Digital Photo Frame or print some photos out.
