# Week 12 Design Sprint  

After we had a conversation with our group members, we decided that we are going to switch our card from "know your medium" to four different stages that our user could really benefit from using our card deck to sort out our production line. 

So the old card is separated based on different mediums; the new card deck will have four different categories, which are: 

- Pre-Production 
- Prototyping and Production 
- Post-Production 
- Channels 

Since this week, my job is more design heavy and design for the individual card deck. I am going to call it to design sprint week. While my group members are working on another survey to help the user to choose the right medium, I am going to document some of my design detail here.
