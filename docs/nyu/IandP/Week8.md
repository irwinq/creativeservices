# Week 8 Time Capsule Part II - The Pentagon Ball Capsule

First, I made my 3D model in Cinema 4D. These steps also allow me to count the polygon of the pentagon ball. I will need 12 polygon face to put together the ball.

## Inside-Out Puzzle

I wish to print a puzzle on the back of my capsule. As we all live in the 21st century, we might all put something digital in the box. I might put something password projected digital stuff inside the box like a phone or tablet or a harddrive contains the video I shoot in a recent couple of years. 

I haven't designed and think about the puzzle on the back. It might be something like a jigsaw puzzle that you have to put the pentagon in the right order to get the passcode.

Additionally, another option is to use the inside as the paper to document the detail and stuff I put inside this box.

One side could say, "Welcome to Irwin's Time Capsule." There will be 12 different surfaces I could write detail on it. I draw this as an example that there are so many things I could put there. 
A lot of people love stickers; they put a lot of stickers on their laptops. The stickers could be the brand they love or club they belong to. I will put some stickers as well. 

## Sci-fi-like Fonts

The whole idea about a time capsule reminds me of time traveling and time machine. I am a huge fan of sci-fi movies. So I wish to design sci-fi-like fonts. I'll be written outside my pentagon ball as well. 

The language I wrote on my ball is based on Chinese characters, but only I can understand (honestly, I kind of forget which characters originated from, but it looks cool though).

## Paper Model

**Something random:**

"I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings, Uh huh, that's right"

Due to the limitation of material I have on my hand currently, I can't make the size I wanted. So with the stock paper I have, I could make half-size of the capsule. Here's the size caparison with my cat.

I design my paper cut-out in the photoshop then print it out. I left a rectangular shape on each of the Pentagon edges so I could use tape or glue it together.

I didn't write stuff on it yet because this is too small for me, so it is a prototype. Also, I think it looks great itself, and I put somewhere in my house as decoration. 
I will stop at Hobby Lobby to buy some bigger PVC board. 

It won't fit everything in my time capsule but most of things.
