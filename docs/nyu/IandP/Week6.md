# Week 6 Photo Essay

::: tip

Fiction. Inspired from real story down below.

:::

I was attacked by a shark. 

Key Largo, FL. 90F. This should be one of my countless dive experiences in the Atlantic ocean. 
Although without provoking the shark, they usually won't aggressively attack human beings. Another reassurance is: their teeth and bite are not legal. Exercising great care, we immediately set a course towards the shore.

This is the creature I never saw in aquariums. I assumed his gender. He seems 8 feet long.

Suddenly, he bit on my gloves. I can't describe that feeling - it feels like he was trying to control his bite, but his size still cause damages. My gloves got a 3-inch tear around my palm. Our dive team members send over a million "Okay?" sign but all paddle away from me.

I am not scared because I can't be. I tried my best to lower my heartbeat because panic will increase the oxygen consumption rate. He swam in front of me and blocked my way while I can't out beat his speed and trying to turn another way. He swam on his side and showed me his left ventral fin. 

Something entangled there, glowing an artificial yellow-greenish fluorescent light. It looks like radioactive Tritium illumination - something should ever exist in the ocean. It was a fishing-line. 

I bet he is showing me that purposely. He suspended in the water like a sci-fi movie flying cars parked in the air. I took off the gloves has his bite mark and untangled the fishing line.

My dive buddy tapped me on the shoulder. I finally picked up my soul. I send a low air sign to my buddy, and he feeds me his secondary regulator.

::: tip About Regulator

Scuba Diving Regulator has Primary Air and Alternate Air. Primary Air has black pipe, Alternative Air has yellow pipe. Alternative Air usually for emergency-usage only.

The nylon neon fishing line still tangled in my mind. I can't imagine how desperate he can be before he reaches a human for help.

They are being attacked by fishing-lines. 
Our fishing-lines. 
They are being attacked by us. 



## Process

Most photos were taken in my bathtub. 

After the return from my dive, since today is Sunday, I haven't return my scuba diving gears yet. I use my GoPro shot every picture because it is waterproofed.

I went to an open water dive this weekend. Our destination was a freshwater lake. During my second dive, I got tangled by a neon fishing line. It is around 40 ft. It seems like someone abandoned the fishing line for a while. 

After I got tangled up with my left arm, I tried to untangle it by myself. But the line is extremely lone and tangled my fin as well. I have to do an emergency ascent and waiting for my crew member to rescue me.  

The fishing line is extremely durable and could hold up a lot of tension. It is extremely dangerous for wildlife. 

Here are some images I gathered online. It is very disturbing.
