## Pre-Research

80% of people answered that they have learned about different kinds of media in textbooks. But no update out of school. 

Only 50% have tried Virtual Reality, Mixed Reality, or Augmented Reality.

**Do you think VR, AR, and MR can be better used in your work? If so, why?** 

- “Yes. **Architecture design and urban planning**, I virtually experience the design first and I can make some revision before the final decision.”
- “I think AR adds color to the **entertainment industry** and might have value in **online education** as well.”
- “I want to use VR for **design**!”
- “I might choose AR or MR as I don’t think they require too much equipment”
- “New media for entertainment and working, traditional for relax”

## User Testing and Feedback

As an Advertising student, I think the set of poker has such important **educational** and **aesthetic** significance. First, each poker card represents an industry term or project process that allows students or entry-level practitioners to **understand or familiarize themselves with real-world cases** quickly. Then, a modern and clean design can lead to better visual experience and user interaction. I believe this is a win-win design that allows users to be **immersed in entertainment** and also learn something.

----- Darren, Brand Strategist, ADPR 

As a student with a background in media studies, I think the set of poker has a clear hierarchy. Each poker card has a symbolic pattern to reflect the key words, which is **very friendly** to media students like me who don't like to read long sentences. And each poker summarizes a short quote, it is easier for users to read the above content to **find inspiration** when using it.
