In the past week, we used several different methods to conduct the brainstorming process. One method I do like is using the card decks. While we love how easy it is the using the card decks, we noticed there are very limited card decks focus on post-production. 

We wanted to create a toolkit that compares different mediums that could benefit both professionals and students. Here's the goal: 

- Compare Key differences between mediums. 
- Point out 

The second part of our deliverables will be a website. Giving the time, we won't have the time to do the coding part and let it be a real website. But we are going to start with wireframes, from low fidelity to high fidelity. 



## Who can use our Website?

Our products will be available for all users who are interested in the new media field. New forms of media consistently emerge while currently there is no tool to help us to choose a proper media. Here’s some people or occupations might use our services: 

### **Creative Director** 

Creative directors serving for advertising agencies usually need to pick the best channel or select certain media for the advertising campaign. While traditional media like newspapers or magazines are straightforward and easy-to-understand, the emerging media is a combination of confusion. Example like, virtual reality and mixed reality requires speciality headset and limited accessibility for certain user groups, the augmented reality could be easily accessed by user through Apple or Google’s ARToolkit. Also most agencies lack programmers so they don’t have the resources to create AR apps without outsourcing. 

### Students

Learning the difference between mediums and how to utilize it better. Learning to develop software and hardware related to the field. Students will also take classes with MR, depending on the circumstances and subjects they are taking. This can be very useful for those who can’t be physically present.

### Filmmakers

Filmmakers and artists will continue to experiment and use these emerging technologies in their work. Those looking to tell their stories in new mediums such as VR, AR, and MR could use our system to decide which is the best approach to go with. Many traditional visual stories could be converted to these new mediums and these cards will help facilitate that process.

### Artists

Artists can paint now in 3D, but they must use the VR headset to do so. There would be some new art forms, not necessarily related to filmmaking. Not necessarily replacing the traditional way. VR can also be used in the fashion industry to see what a piece looks like on someone before making it. Saves a lot of material, but might take more time in prototyping.



## Insight from Interview

We are still working on more interview questions because it's a really tricky situation for a couple of reasons: 

- Part of our final project will be a one-way interaction website. You could learn something from it. To conduct research will be necessary after the first demo. 
- We still need to reword a lot of questions, and we believe conduct an internal interview might be a better option. 
- At this stage, we are going to shifting our focus to developing the wireframe and prototype. 

Currently, we gathered some response from the website, here's some insight I gathered:

- Generation Z is not use traditional media very often. 
- Out of 14 responses, only 1 people ever use direct paper mail 
- While new media is booming, we still need to learn about old mediums. 



## How to use our card deck

I am still working on making cards, but as this point, I would love to show you that how this card might be useful. 

You can always use this as playing card.

Here's little story: 

Owen is a student majoring advertising. One of her assignment is about to create an advertising campaign for local fast food brand. He need to pick which medium that he could pick or when. So he could pick the card and put into a calendar. 

He is considering to put an ads on local newspaper and outdoor billboard. In order to do that, he need graphic design resources, and logo, photography resources.

He is planning to do the digital content on 28th, so he need motion graphics design, cinematography / videography and background music.
