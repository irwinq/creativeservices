For this assignment, I wanted to create a funny, goofy, and sarcastic comic. Then put together as the animation. Here's the result first.

## Script and Audio

**Background**: Downloading Center 

**Professor**: Ok, kids, today, everyone is going to get a time capsule. That's one of the fun things your ancestors like to do. Each one will get one times capsules. This is part of their project at their University. I am expecting your essay upload to my head before Friday midnight. 

**Kid A**: Ooookay, professor, but, what is University? 

**Professor**: It's the place they could learn new knowledge. 

**Kid A**: So what is learn? 

**Professor**: Learn is the process they got new knowledge and store in their brain, they are dumb, and they are forgettable, you should have this. This will tell you everything about our ancestors. Ok, this kids should not see this.  

**Kid A**: Ok, I'm ready to upload. Holy Crap. 



**Kid A**: Ahh, I don't like my time capsule. It looks like s** ball. 

**Kid B**: Ahh, I don't give a *, Look at new iPhone 55, I am richer than you. 



**Kid A**: Let's open this thing

**Kid B**: Emm Hmm Emm Hmm

**Kid A**: A Dumbbell, no wonder why they were so dumb 

**Kid A**: And who is this guy named Irwin, OK, maybe he's a dog

**Kid B**: Sounds like loser to me. 

**Kid A**: Essentials of strength training and conditioning. 

**Kid B**: What's this? 

**Kid A**: It seems like how accent human get muscle. 

**Kid B**: Do you want get some muscle?  



## Drawing

I draw everything on my iPad on Procreate. Then export to After Effects and Media Encoder. I was definitely influenced by the odd1sout and Danny Casale. 



## Lip Syncing

Lip syncing probably is the most different job in my animation. This is another project that I spend so much time on it. Second, compared to 50 rendings.  Here's a screenshot of my project file.

I have to put the right time keyframe whenever the lip moves. One trick to do that is to open the waveform of the audio so you could see the peak of the audio. Usually, during the peak, the lips will move. This method helped me to get through lip sync for all of my animations. 

## Questions asked

This animation seems brainless and goofy, like something to watch when you feel stress out. But there are some real questions I like to ask. 

When technology like Elon Musk's Neuralink, an interface between brain and machine technology, matured in the future. Our brain could function as a hard drive; our memory and knowledge could be written down on a chip. 

Do we still need to learn? Will the University become what's in the comic,  upload/download center? If we could memorize everything and never forget, will it be a good thing or a bad thing? 

In our history, there are so many trends or traditions that are harmful to our human body. 

Example like:

- Female genital mutilation/cutting in Africa, 
- Foot binding (old Chinese custom wrapping feet so it will be smaller)
-  The history of the corset

Today, the blue pill in the comic exists, and that's the steroid. Some people were looking for a shortcut to get muscle, choose the patch of taking the steroid. It could seriously damage the genital, endocrine, and cardiovascular system. 

What if: in the future, the muscle will be treated as low-level because they need to do physical activity, while the upper level could just use their brain?

Another issue I would love to discuss is, things hard to access in the past might change over the years. In the last class, we talked about before social media and the ways of entertaining is so lacking, we often feel very joyful with new ways to entertain. Today, we have so many ways, and it's overwhelming, so we won't feel as happy as before. Maybe in the future, everyone will get a super-smart brain, good looking face, six ads, and strong physics through generic modification; what will we flighting for?
