# Week 10 Research for Design

For a very long time, the stuff we see on the screen is moving is pretty common, from movie to TV shows to the video on the app. Every frame is refreshing our memories. 

We learn from it. We suffer from it. For a large portion of our daily life, we spend time with the images that move. 

As a motion designer, it is part of my job every day. But I never asked myself, how does everything evolve to the things we now recognized and get used to? What is the history behind it? 

The film, animation, 3D, and motion graphics seem all related, but how are they related? 
When did they start to separate? 

If we could draw a line, where is the line between file and animation, 2D and 3D animation, graphics design, and motion graphic design? 

They are all connected and shared the same nature. They all evolved from one source. 

The earliest motion graphic design showed up in the early stage of the movie. Our group is planning to work together. Everyone familiar with one aspect of this big puzzle; we go out, explore, and dig in different directions. I believe inevitable our route will be interweaving together. 

I am going to keep this short but keep more content in our group documentation as well as the miro board.
