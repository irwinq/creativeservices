# Week 5 New Metaphors

## Final Result

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irwinchyi/imgbed/master/img/Final%20Result.jpg)

## Detail

For this project, I decided that I am going to use the current Brainstorm cards to generate a novel spin. 

I chose Dan Lockton's New Metaphors Toolkit as my deck. I am going to randomly draw 2 to 3 cards from Image cards, then 1 to 2 cards from concept cards. 

After the random drawing process, I have those image cards: 

| Two cards from Concepts card                                 | Two cards from Image Cards                                   |

## Different colored Windows 

The concept cards I draw are very general. So I start to think about my problem with a signpost and different colored windows. For the different colored windows, the first thing I think about is the skyscrapers have the one-way transparent glass. You can't see inside the buildings from the outside. Or, the mirror is a big screen. There are some products in the market using a mirror as a screen. 

One product I think is cool called Mirror by Lululemon.

I believe my product should use glass as the carrier for the message. The glass itself can't deliver any message, so it will be as a combination as a screen. 

I really want to persuade you - while you are reading this article - everything in my imaginary product is feasible, approachable, and not limited by current technology. 

I did a lot of research about the transparent screen. Xiaomi, a Chinese technology company, released its first fully transparent TV.

Summarize, my first idea is **a transparent glass screen.** 



## A Signpost

Signpost is everywhere from the metro station to super mall's intersection. In Nebraska, a signpost is not very common because most of the time, you need navigations; you are driving. I grew up in a big city in China called Xi'an, with a population of 12 million. We have five metro lines currently using, and they are still building more. Xi'an has a long history because it is the capital of 13 dynasties in ancient Chinese history. The street and city urban planning inherited from the Dang dynasty of chessboard-like road. 

### Quick background about Xi'an

In the center of Xi'an,  there is a building named Bell Tower. Around it, it's the center of Xi'an. You can call it downtown. There is an underpass named Bell Tower underpass.  Xi'an has four mean streets named North, South, East, West Mainstreet. Bell Tower underpass has ten exits.
While I see the keyword of "signpost," the first thing that came up to my mind is the signpost in Bell Tower underpass. The underpass itself is very confusing, and the signpost makes it worse. I spend 20 years growing up in that city as a native, and I got lost all the time. Here's an image of Bell Tower signpost.

And they named exit like

- North Mainstreet West Exit 
- East Mainstreet North Exit 
- East Mainstreet South Exit 

It is definitely very confusing for tourists, and anyone arrived in Xi'an for the first time. 

I wish to redesign the Xi'an underpass signpost using a transparent glass screen. Since you have celling walking underground, the screen could hang in all four directions, or an annulus shape screen and you can see things in all directions. 

Here is a quick sketch of my idea:

Since I could not physically back to China and take photos for mockups. I found this photo online.

I used Cinema 4D camera tracking to track the X,Y, and Z-axis. Then created the shape of the screen on the top. I rendered an empty shape of the screen and added signpost in Photoshop.

This product - when the passenger is standing in the center, and under the glass - they could check the place they need to go very easily. I remembered every time I went to the Bell Tower underpass because it is underground, there is no GPS signal. I believe this product could bring people calmness in technology.

## Future

All the sci-fi movies in recent years imagined a world filled with front-projected holographic display technology. But honestly, the technology isn't there yet. The transparent glass and screen is a more approachable way. It could also be used as a bus stop board, commercial billboard. Maybe the next time you visit a boutique fashion store on the street, their shopwindow is not only glass but also a screen.
