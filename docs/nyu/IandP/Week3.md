# Week 3 50 Renderings

## Intro

As an international student, travel long distant and long hour is unavoidable. The essentials during travel could be IDs like passport, backpack. But most importantly, a suitcase. No matter a carry-on or luggage, I can't go anywhere without it. So I pick the suitcase. 

I decided to choose several different rendering forms, including 2D drawing, 3D rendered image or 3D animation,  and a true story about luggage. 

It's a lot, and I do not want to compromise the quality of it. So I will make sure at least each media have some of the good work. 

This assignment probably is the most time-consuming assignment in my college life. But I am pleased with the result I created. 



## Media: Canvas

> Draw by iPad Pro, Apple Pencil and App Procreate Pro. Some drawing inspirations from Google  luggage sketches or real image of suitcases as reference. Some Color Pallets used [Colorhunt.co](https://colorhunt.co/)

## Media: 3D Space

Starting with something plain, I created and modeled this suitcase in Cinema 4D.

I started to try different texture, and see how it looks like.

Then something won't exist, glass / crystal luggage.

Went back to make something looks more real. Combine my render to photos.

## Media: Word

### Cuohuo

My dad always yells at me when I am spending money on anything expensive. He always feels if there is a lower-priced alternative, I should pick the cheaper one. In Mandarine, we have the word "Couhuo," literally, it means you put a few mediocre things together, budgeting, and you could make do with it, live it. It's an attitude always to settle down if when you shouldn't. Never flight for anything but to grin and bear it. 

My dad is a "Cuohuo" person. If something electronic is broken or does not perform supposedly, he kicked it and lived with the broken one. I never appreciate this attitude, and sometimes he even blames me for doing not settle down. 

Once I was arguing with him that he could afford a good meal, but he went to a fast-food restaurant and ordered some cheap, junk food. He has diabetes; this lifestyle could kill him. I opposed several times, but he never listens to me. He said, "I just a meal, cuohuo cuohuo, just fine, just fine." 

I got my offer from one college in the U.S. He is genuinely happy for me and drives me to a local market to purchase a new suitcase. I directly went to the Samsonite store cause it's a  pretty solid brand. I picked a black one up and took a closer look. His facial expression twisted and squeezed together when he saw the price tag. He dragged me outside and ordered me to pick another brand. 

I am both mad and sad. "I am going to travel thousands of miles away. Have you ever thought of if my language break at the airport, how embarrassing and disparate I will be? " 

"Cuohuo, cuohuo. And you are a boy, and you don't have a lot of things to pack." 

"What you always so mean and stinginess? It's not what we can't afford it. And you know it will be worth the price." I put on my blamer coat. 

"The cheaper one could do the same job, why spend more money on things could do the same job?" 

I can't remember what I said after that, definitely not some good word. I took the bus back home without him and maintained quiet on the dinner table. 

My dad saw me back, he said: 

"Hey, I found the luggage online, the same brand, it's like 20 bucks cheaper, I already ordered. You're right. You do need a good quality one."

I didn't say anything and walked away. I was mad he has to fight about this for 20 bucks cheaper. 
Today, I pull out my old Samsonite luggage, traveling around the world. He saved, cuohuo in so many aspects, 20 bucks at a time. Together, he helped me covered my college tuition. How many time he have to cuohuo? So it could be enough for the U.S. college?

"We can't cuohuo education." He agrees with my grandpa who raised me. 

He cuohuo everything himself but never once cuohuo for me. 



# In-class: Mask

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irwinchyi/imgbed/master/img/dsjakldjlsajdla.png)

Like a lot of people do, biking is both good cardio and fun. But currently, COVID makes it harder to approach because it's hard to wear a mask and a helmet to do cardio. Mask makes it hard to get enough oxygen when you are riding the bike. 

Another issue I am facing when I ride a bike is the navigate through the road. Sometimes, I bike between school and home. During the first couple of ride, I get lost constantly. So I have to stop and pull my phone out, check the Google Map, then see where to go next. Sometimes, I will take my phone out and take a peek on the maps while still riding the bike. I shouldn't do it; it's pretty dangerous. 

For the first question solution, there is a lot of wind flow into the helmet when I ride fast. So why not using that part of wind to filtrate the air? The rider could get fresh air effortlessly; with the same protection from N95, they could wear the helmet to public places without wear the helmet and mask at the same time. 

Solving the second issue, I hope to add the plastic shield, which is a screen showing up the image port from the phone through Bluetooth. I tried the Hololens once, and it is very interesting. And I hope the same technology could be on the helmet. Maybe there could be a solar panel on the top of the helmet so it won't need any battery charge.
