# Week 1 Fantasy Device

::: tip Deviated from Group Idea
Our group was short on time during the discussion time due to Zoom connection issue. Couple of days ago, when I do my dishes, I came up with this idea. I hope it's okay to deviate from our group idea.

## Auto Load - Unload Dishwasher

### Sketch

### Main Functions

- On the upper side of the dishwasher door, you can feed the plate in like you feed CD to the CD player 
- Whenever you need a plate, simply press the DELOAD DISH button, and it will feed you a new one
- The detergent will now put it from the upper side of the machine, so you don't have to bent over to reach it
- Inside, the upper level has hooks/claws to automatically load and deload the plate for you  
- The lover level, you can still use as normal dish washer



### Story Behind it

The dishwasher is not common in a Chinese family. Growing up, washing dishes is always part of me and my mom's job because my dad is the chief. 

When I first arrived in the U.S. and got my own apartment. I never use my dishwasher for a very long time because I don't know how to use it. (I don't even know what detergent is) I use the dishwasher as an extra place to drain and dry out my glassware. I visited my friends' house, and he taught me how to load the plate properly. He even gave me a few detergent blocks to let me try it out. 

The first time when my dishes is ready and clean, I Wowed like Cave Man met the new iPhone. I bragged it with my mom and showed her how effortlessly to wash the dishes. And there are a few problems I hate about using the dishwasher: 

- When I have lower back pain, the last thing I want to do is bend over and put detergent there; why it can't load five detergents at the same time? 
- I hate load dishes, and sometimes I load it wrong, so there always some dishes that are not cleaned properly.
- I hate to unload the dishes. Dishwasher spoiled me not to wash dishes, why not spoil me a little bit more? Could I load and unload the dish for me?

Hence, I create and sketched this idea of autoload/ unload dishwasher. The inspiration is coming from the CDROM on cars or gaming console. You push the disk in, and the machine will take it inside. Also, there will be  a button there. When the dishwasher finished its washing cycle, the LED indicates the dish is clean, and it will let you know how many dishes are left inside it. Pressing that button will unload the plate for you. 

Another improvement is adding a pod capsule for detergent. You only need to refill the Rinse Aid one time, and it will last for a couple of wash cycles. But you have to put new detergent every single wash. By adding extra space for detergent, you only need to refill it once a week. 

Another potential feature could be adding some Smart features like auto start after its full. 



#### **Few Pain Points of the current product**

- Load and unload process 
- For the over tray: Bend over, stand up, bend over, stand up for the dishes
- Detergent has to be loaded every single time 



#### **Final Thought** 

Sometimes people go to a party, and the host provided plastic tableware for every guest. Part of the reason could be they don't have enough tableware for everyone. Another reason might be they want to save the time to wash and clean the so many dishes. Dishwasher already saved us a lot of time, so we could enjoy the extra time while cooking, eating, and talking with family. Why not make it save us more time? Also less plastic.
