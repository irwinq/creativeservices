# Week 2 Endangered Animal

"Elephants never forget" I remember to read this as little kids, amazed by how intelligent but also giant they are. Since then, Elephants is my favorite animal. 

Currently, near all kinds of elephants are engendered, even critically endangered. According to WWF, those species of elephants are endangered or vulnerable: 

[Sumatran Elephant](https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/sumatran-elephant) 	[Asian Elephant](https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/asian-elephant)	[Bornean Elephant](https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/bornean-elephant)	[Indian Elephant](https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/indian-elephant)

[Sri Lankan Elephant](https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/sri-lankan-elephant)	[African Elephant](https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/african-elephant)	[Forest Elephant](https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/forest-elephant)	[Savanna Elephant](https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/savanna-elephant)

According to WWF, Asian elephants, the largest manual inhabited dry to west forest and grassland in the south and southeast Asia. And human has deep connections and associations with elephants ([WWF](https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/asian-elephant)).  In Thailand and Buddhism culture, elephants are sacred animals. From 1817 to 1917, the Flags of Thailand has a white elephant on it ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Thai_flags)).

In our culture, although it's not sacred as Thai culture, we value and symbolize elephants. As qualities like erudite, sophisticated. Also, in Mandarine, 象(elephants) has the same pronunciation as 祥 (auspicious). It's given the meaning of lucky, auspicious, healthy. We describe elephants as powerful, giant with superior strength, but still moderate in temper. Also symbolize honesty, sincere and kind.

## Sketch and Construct

I started with some cardboard I gathered recently among with few plastic water bottles and soda cans. I cut out the head's shape from cardboard and then used Magic Erase in the middle to hold its structure. The shape of the ears used the same method. I cut a block of used sponge so the ear could hold in a certain angle.

After that, I draw the shape of the elephant body in cardboard. This kind of cardboard it's very thick that I couldn't use scissors to cut through. So I have to use a knife to cut the shape out carefully.

I used a soda can and plastic bottle to hole in between in the middle of the body cardboard. I put a plastic bottle because it's easy to reshape. Also, it could be the conjoined part of the elephant's head and body.

I used a few things I can find in my house to fix two cardboard together—some scotch tape and dental floss for the long nose part.

I went to Walmart to pick up some school glue for 50 cents, also some gray paint color. By tearing down a recycled paper bag, I glued the paper on it patch by patch. Here's the result. I didn't design ivory intentionally.

I was planning to glue some white napkin on it for the final step and let it ready to be painted. Then I decided not to for couple reason: 

- I like the current woody paper color; it feels like something old but natural, like an old, sophisticate elephant 
- By adding the white napkin layer, this work it will be no longer purely from recycled material 
- The look itself indicates its made from recycled stuff, also the patch it gives different feelings. 

## Final Result
