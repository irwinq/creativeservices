# Principles in Exercise Physiology 

**Overload Principle**

If you habitually overload a system, it will respond and adapt. 

**Reversibility**

Whereas overloading will result in training adaptations, in activity will result in a return a baseline. 



# Calorimetry & Oxygen Consumption

**Calorimetry**
Measurement of the heat production in calories. Estimates metabolic rate by estimate heat production. 

Indirect - Measure Oxygen Consumption 

Relations between Amount of oxygen consumed and the heat production released during exercise. Breakdown of our fuels in the energy producing pathways. 

Vâ€˜O2 

Respiratory Exchange Ratio (RER or R) = V'CO2 / VO2



# ATP & Muscular Work

Adenosine Triphosphate

Only ATP can be used directly to supply the energy needed for the exercise.
