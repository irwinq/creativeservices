# Six Basic Movements 基础动作

## 3 Types of Muscle Contractions:

**Concentric**: Tension that involves shortening of the muscle  向心运动

**Eccentric**: Tensions that involves lengthening of the muscle 离心运动

**Isometric**: Tension that involves no change in muscle length. 等长收缩

- Lowing the body towards the group

#### Side View

- Hips extend behind
- Knees come over or slightly pass toes 
- Upper body has slight bend 
- Back stays in a neutral position 

#### Front View 

- Knees are out 
- Upper body is vertical 

#### Muscles Used

Gluteus Maximus (butt)

- One of the strongest muscles in the body 
- Responsible for hip extension, or the movement of your hips forward

### Hinge 臀部铰链

Hinging involves the movement primarily of the hip joint, and secondary of the knee and ankle joints

- Extending your hips behind you with slight knee bend

Hinge differs from Squat 

- More hip extension 
- More upper body lean 
- Less knee and ankle movement 

High Technique 

- Slight knee bend, about 20 degrees 
- Hip extends behind you 
- Knees stay over ankle 
- Back stays in neutral position 

#### Muscle Use

Gluteus Maximus

Hamstrings

Focuses on strengthening one leg at a time



**Side View**

- Front Knee does not move beyond toes 
- Torso stays upright 
- Back stays in neutral position

Focuses on strengthening core stability 

Exercises

Anti-Rotation

The ability to prevent core rotation 

#### Muscle Used

**Rectus Abdominis (abs)**

Located in the front of the body 

Responsible for flexing and rotating the trunk 

**Obliques**

Located on each side of the rectus abdominis, run from the low ribs to the pelvis 

**Low back stabilizing muscles**
